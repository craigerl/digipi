kiss3 - Python KISS Module
**************************

.. image:: https://github.com/python-aprs/kiss3/actions/workflows/pytest.yml/badge.svg
    :target: https://github.com/python-aprs/kiss3/actions

kiss3 is a Python Module that implements the
`KISS Protocol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_(TNC)>`_ for
communicating with KISS-enabled devices (such as Serial or TCP TNCs)
and provides support for encoding and decoding AX.25 frames.

Versions
========

- 8.x branch from ``python-aprs`` as ``kiss3``, supports python 3.6+

Previous versions were released by ``ampledata`` as ``kiss``:

- 7.x.x branch and-on will be Python 3.x ONLY.
- 6.5.x branch will be the last version of this Module that supports Python 2.7.x

Installation
============
Install from pypi using pip: ``pip install kiss3``


Usage Examples
==============
Read & print frames from a TNC connected to '/dev/ttyUSB0' at 1200 baud::

    import kiss

    def p(x): print(x)  # prints whatever is passed in.

    k = kiss.SerialKISS('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1200)
    k.start()  # inits the TNC, optionally passes KISS config flags.
    k.read(callback=p)  # reads frames and passes them to `p`.

Testing
=======
Run tox::
