Sidestep :code:`import` and load Python files as relative paths.

Intended for one-off imports (e.g. global configuration). Currently, :code:`thesmuggler` can't import files that import other local packages, but you can :code:`smuggle` files that
have already smuggled other files.

Tested and working on Python 2.7 and up.

Usage
-----

:code:`pip install thesmuggler`, then:

.. code:: python

    from thesmuggler import smuggle

    # Ã€ la `import weapons`
    weapons = smuggle('weapons.py')

    # Ã€ la `from contraband import drugs, alcohol`
    drugs, alcohol = smuggle('drugs', 'alcohol', source='contraband.py')

    # Ã€ la `from contraband import drugs as dope, alcohol as booze`
    dope, booze = smuggle('drugs', 'alcohol', source='contraband.py')
