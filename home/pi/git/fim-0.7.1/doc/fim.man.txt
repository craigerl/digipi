       fim - Fbi (linux framebuffer imageviewer) IMproved, an universal image viewer

SYNOPSIS
       fim [{options}] [--] {imagepath} [{imagepaths}]

       fim --help[=s|d|l|m] [{help-item} ...]

DESCRIPTION
       fim  is  a `swiss army knife' for displaying image files.  It is capable of displaying image files using different graphical devices while offering a uniform look and feel.
       Key bindings are customizable and specified in an initialization file.  Interaction with standard input and output is possible, especially in shell  scripts.   An  internal
       scripting  language specialized for image viewing allows image navigation, scaling, manipulation of internal variables, command aliases, and Vim-like autocommands.  The in‐
       ternal language can be interacted with via a command line mode capable of autocompletion and history (the readline mode).  Further features are display of EXIF  tags,  JPEG
       comments, EXIF rotation/orientation, load of "description files", faster load via image caching, command recording, and much more.

       As  a  default, fim displays the specified file(s) on the detected, most convenient graphical device. This can be with SDL if running under X, an ASCII-art driver (aalib or
       libcaca) if running behind ssh without X forwarding, or the linux framebuffer device. Graphical file formats BMP, PCX are supported natively, while JPEG,  PNG,  GIF,  TIFF,
       PPM,  PGM,  PBM,  QOI,  AVIF,  WEBP are supported via third party libraries.  Further formats are supported via external converters.  For XCF (Gimp's) images, 'xcftopnm' or
       'xcf2pnm' is used.  For FIG vectorial images, 'fig2dev' is used.  For DIA vectorial images, 'dia' is used.  For NEF raw camera images, 'dcraw' is used.  For  SVG  vectorial
       images, 'inkscape' is used.  For other formats ImageMagick's 'convert' is used.  The converter is given 15 seconds for the conversion before a timeout.

       If {imagepath} is a file, its format is guessed not by its name but by its contents. See the _file_loader variable to change this default.

       If  {imagepath}  is a directory, load files of supported formats contained there. If {imagepath} contains a trailing slash (/), it is treated as a directory; otherwise that
       is checked via stat(2). To change this default, see description of the _pushdir_re variable and the --no-stat-push and --recursive options.

       This man page describes fim command line options and usage.  See man fimrc(5) for a full specification of the fim  language,  commands,  keysyms,  autocommands,  variables,
       aliases, examples for a configuration file and readline usage samples.

USAGE
       You may invoke fim from an interactive shell and control it with the keyboard, as you would do with any image viewer with reasonable key bindings.

       fim  is  keyboard  oriented: there are no user menus or buttons available.  If you need some feature or setting which is not accessible from the default keyboard configura‐
       tion, you probably need a custom configuration or simply need to type a custom command. For these, you can use the internal command and configuration language.

       See options --read-from-stdin, --script-from-stdin, and --image-from-stdin for more script-oriented usages.

       The full commands specification is also accessible at runtime using the internal help system (typing :help).

OPTIONS
       Accepted command line {options}:

       --     Treat arguments after -- as filenames.  Treat arguments before -- as command line options if these begin with -, and as filenames otherwise.

       -a, --autozoom
              Enable autozoom. Automagically pick a reasonable zoom factor when displaying a new image (as in fbi).

       -b[24|1], --binary[=24|1]
              Display contents of binary files (of any filetype) as these were raw 24 or 1 bits per pixel pixelmaps.  The width of this image will not  exceed  the  value  of  the
              _preferred_rendering_width variable.  Regard this as an easter bunny option.

       --as-text
              Display  contents  of  files  (of  any  filetype)  as these were text.  The width of this image will not exceed the value of the _preferred_rendering_width variable.
              Non-printable characters are then displayed as " ".  Regard this as another easter bunny option.

       --cd-and-readdir
              Step in the directory of the first file to be loaded, push other files from that directory, and jump back to the first file.  Useful when invoking from a desktop en‐
              vironment.

       -c {commands}, --execute-commands {commands}
              Execute  {commands} after reading the initialization file, just before entering the interactive mode.  No semicolon (;) is required at the end of {commands}.  Do not
              forget quoting {commands} in a manner suitable to your shell.  So  -c next  is fine as it is.   A  more  complicated  example,  with  quotings:  -c  '*2;2pan_up;dis‐
              play;while(1){align  "bottom";sleep  "1" ; align "top"}' (with the single quotes) tells fim to: double the displayed image size, pan twice up, display the image, and
              finally do an endless loop consisting of bottom and top aligning, alternated.

       -C {commands}, --execute-commands-early {commands}
              Similar to the --execute-commands option, but execute {commands} earlier, just before reading the initialization file.  If {commands} takes the special 'early'  form
              =var=val, it assigns value val to variable var immediately, before the interpreter is started, and with no value quoting needed.

              For example, -C '_scale_style=" "' starts fim no auto-scaling; the equivalent early form is: -C '=_scale_style= '.

       -d {fbdev}, --device {fbdev}
              Framebuffer device to use. Default is the one your vc is mapped to (as in fbi).

       --dump-reference-help[=man]
              Dump to stdout language reference help and quit.

       --dump-default-fimrc
              Dump default configuration (the one hardcoded in the fim executable) to standard output and quit.

       -E {scriptfile}, --execute-script {scriptfile}
              Execute {scriptfile} after the default initialization file is read, and before executing --execute-commands commands.

       -f {fimrc}, --etc-fimrc {fimrc}
              Specify   an  alternative  system-wide  initialization  file  (default:  /usr/local/etc/fimrc),  to  be  read  prior  to  any  other  configuration  file.  See  also
              --no-etc-fimrc-file.

       -F {commands}, --final-commands {commands}
              Similar to the --execute-commands option, but execute {commands} after exiting the interactive mode, just before terminating the program.

       -h[s|d|l|m], --help[=s|d|l|m]
              Print program invocation help, and exit. Depending on the option, output can be: short, descriptive, long from man,  or  complete  man.  For  each  further  argument
              {help-item} passed to fim, an individual help message is shown. If {help-item} starts with a /, it is treated as a search string (not a regexp, though).

       -k {keysym}, --keysym-press {keysym}
              Execute  any command bound (via the bind command) to a specified keysym at startup. A keysym can be prefixed by a repetition count number. You can specify the option
              multiple times to simulate multiple keystrokes. Presses entered via --keysym-press are processed with the same priority as those entered via --chars-press, that  is,
              as they appear. See man fimrc(5) for a list of keysyms and the use of bind.

       -K {chars}, --chars-press {chars}
              Input  one  or  more keyboard characters at program startup (simulate keyboard presses). This option can be specified multiple times. Each additional time (or if the
              string is empty), a press of Enter (ASCII code 0x0D) key is prepended. Examples: -K '' simulates press of an Enter;  -K ':next;' activates the command line and enter
              "next;"  without executing it;  -K ":next;" -K "next" executes "next", stays in the command line and enter keys "next";  -K ":next;" -K "" -K "next" executes "next",
              leaves the command line, and executes in sequence any command bound to keys 'n', 'e', 'x', 't'. Presses entered via --chars-press are processed with the same  prior‐
              ity as those entered via --keysym-press, that is, as they appear.

       -D {filename}, --load-image-descriptions-file {filename}
              Load image descriptions from file {filename}. Each line begins with the basename of an image file, followed by a Tab character (or a different character if specified
              via --image-descriptions-file-separator), then the description text. The description text is copied into the i:_comment variable of the image at load time,  overrid‐
              ing  the  comment possibly loaded from the file (e.g. JPEG, PNG or TIFF comment). If a '@' followed by an identifier {identifier} is encountered, and i:{var} is set,
              its value is substituted here. If "@#" is encountered, the remainder of the description line is ignored. Special comment lines like "#!fim:{var}={val}" lead  i:{var}
              to  be  assigned  value  {val}  (unquoted)  at  image  loading  time  (cached  variable),  unless  {var}  starts with an underscore ('_'). Special comment lines like
              "#!fim:@{var}={val}" create a  variable  {var}  that  are  only  valid  in  expanding  @{var}  in  comments.  Special  comment  lines  like  "#!fim:{var}@={val}"  or
              "#!fim:@{var}@={val}  (notice  @  before =) also expand whatever @{identifier} encountered in {val} . Special comment lines like "#!fim:+={val}" add {val} to current
              description. Special comment lines like "#!fim:^={val}" set {val} to be the base of each description. Special comment lines like "#!fim:!=" reset  all  cached  vari‐
              ables.  Special  comment  lines  like  "#!fim:/={dir}" prepend {dir} to each file's basename. Special comment lines like "#!fim:\={dir}" prepend {dir} to each file's
              name. Special description text (to be associated to an image) begins with markers:  with "#!fim:=", the last description line is reused; with "#!fim:+", what follows
              is  appended  to the last description line; with "#!fim:^", what follows is prepended to the last description line; with "#!fim:s/{f}/{t}", the last description line
              is used and substituted substring {t} to occurrences of substring {f} ({f} and {t} cannot contain newlines or a '/'). If {val} is empty that variable is unset. These
              variables  are  stored  also in an internal index used by the limit command. This option sets _caption_over_image=2, so that a caption is displayed over the image. A
              description file beginning with "#!fim:desc" can be loaded without specifying this switch.

       -S {sepchar}, --image-descriptions-file-separator {sepchar}
              A character to be used as a separator between the filename and the description part of lines specified just before a --load-image-descriptions-file.

       -i, --image-from-stdin
              Read one single image from the standard input (the image data, not the filename).  May not work with all supported file formats.  In the image list, this image takes
              the special name "<STDIN>".

       --mark-from-image-descriptions-file {filename}
              Set those files specified in {filename} (see --load-image-descriptions-file for the file format) as marked (see the list command).

       -m {vmode}, --mode {vmode}
              Name  of  the  video  mode  to  use  video  mode  (must  be  listed  in  /etc/fb.modes).  Default is not to change the video mode.  In the past, the XF86 config file
              (/etc/X11/XF86Config) used to contain Modeline information, which could be fed to the modeline2fb perl script (distributed with fbset).  On many  modern  xorg  based
              systems,  there  is  no direct way to obtain a fb.modes file from the xorg.conf file.  So instead one could obtain useful fb.modes info by using the (fbmodes (no man
              page AFAIK)) tool, written by bisqwit.  An unsupported mode should make fim exit with failure.  But it is possible the kernel could trick fim  and  set  a  supported
              mode automatically, thus ignoring the user set mode.

       -N, --no-rc-file
              No personal initialization file is read (default is ~/.fimrc) at startup.

       --no-etc-fimrc-file
              No system-wide initialization file is read (default is /usr/local/etc/fimrc) at startup. See also --etc-fimrc.

       --no-internal-config
              No internal default configuration at startup (uses internal variable _no_default_configuration). Will only provide a minimal working configuration.

       --no-commandline
              With internal command line mode disabled.

       --no-history-save
              Do not save execution history at finalization (uses internal variable _save_fim_history).

       --no-history-load
              Do not load execution history at startup.

       --no-history
              Do not load or save execution history at startup.

       -p, --script-from-stdin
              Read commands from stdin before entering in interactive mode.

       -o [fb|sdl|gtk|ca|aa|dumb][={gfxopts}], --output-device [fb|sdl|gtk|ca|aa|dumb][={gfxopts}]
              Use  the  specified  device  (one among fb|sdl|gtk|ca|aa|dumb) as fim video output device, overriding automatic checks.  If the device is empty and followed by {gfx‐
              opts}, it will be selected automatically.  The available devices depend on the current environment and on the configuration and compilation options.  You can get the
              list of available output devices issuing fim --version.  The possible values to {gfxopts} that we describe here can also be passed as "display 'reinit' {gfxopts}" --
              see man fimrc for this.  The device name with options (perhaps with modifications due to auto-detection) is stored in variable _device_string.  The fb option selects
              the  Linux framebuffer. Presence of {gfxopts} with value 'S' (e.g. 'fb=S') makes framebuffer initialization more picky: it does not tolerate running in a screen ses‐
              sion.  The ca option (coloured ASCII-art) can be specified as ca[={['w']['h']['H']['d:'DITHERMODE]}] ; if supplied, 'w' selects windowed mode,  provided  libcaca  is
              running  under X; by default (or with 'W'), windowed mode is being turned off internally during initialization by unsetting the DISPLAY environment variable. If 'd:'
              is present, the DITHERMODE following it will be passed as dither algorithm string (alternatively, it  can  be  a  non-negative  number,  too).   The  aa  (monochrome
              ASCII-art) option can be specified as aa[={['w'|'W']}]; if supplied, 'w' selects windowed mode, provided aalib is running under X; by default (or with 'W'), windowed
              mode is being turned off internally during initialization by unsetting the DISPLAY environment variable.  Please note that the readline (internal command line) func‐
              tionality    in    ca    and    aa    modes    is    limited.     If    the    graphical    windowed   mode   is    sdl    or    gtk    it   can   be   followed   by
              ={['w']['m']['r']['h']['W']['M']['R']['H'][width[:height]]['%']}, where width and height are integer numbers specifying the desired resolution  (if height not speci‐
              fied,  it  takes the value of width); the 'w' character requests windowed mode (instead of 'W' for fullscreen); the 'm' character requests mouse pointer display; the
              'h' character requests help grid map draw (can be repeated for variants); the 'r' character requests support for window resize; the '%' character requests  to  treat
              width  and  height as percentage of possible window resolution. The same letters uppercase request explicit negation of the mentioned features.  Additionally, in gtk
              mode: 'b' hides the menu bar, 'e' starts with empty menus, 'f' rebuilds the menus, and 'D' removes the menus. Note: the gtk mode is a recent addition  and  may  have
              defects. The sdl mode works best with libsdl-2; libsdl-1.2 support is being discontinued.
               The imlib2 option requests imlib2 and is unfinished: do not use it.
               The dumb test mode is there only for test purposes and is not interactive.

       --offset {bytes-offset[{:upper-offset}|{+offset-range}]}
              Use  the specified offset (in bytes) for opening the specified files. If :upper-offset is specified, further bytes until upper-offset are probed. If +offset-range is
              specified instead, that many additional bytes are to be probed.  Use this option to search  damaged  file  systems  for  image  files.  Appending  a  modifier  among
              'K','M','G' (case irrelevant) to an offset number changes the unit to be respectively 2^10, 2^20, or 2^30 bytes.

       --pread-cmd {cmd-filter-pipeline}
              Specify  a  shell  command  with {cmd-filter-pipeline}. If the current filename matches "^[/A-Za-z0-9_.][/A-Za-z0-9_.-]*$", it is be substituted to any occurrence of
              '{}'. The resulting command output is assumed to be file data, which is read, decoded, and displayed.  This works by setting the internal _pread_cmd variable  (empty
              by default).

       -P, --text-reading
              Enable textreading mode.  This has the effect that fim displays images scaled to the width of the screen, and aligned to the top.  If the images you are watching are
              text pages, all you have to do to get the next piece of text is to press space (in the default key configuration, of course).

       -s {value}, --scroll {value}
              Set scroll steps for internal variable _steps (default is "20%").

       --slideshow {number}
              Interruptible slideshow mode. Wait for {number} of seconds (can have a decimal part, and is assigned to the _slideshow_sleep_time variable) after each image.  Imple‐
              mented   by   executing   reload;   i:fresh=1;   while(_fileindex  <=  _filelistlen-_loop_only_once){sleep  _slideshow_sleep_time;  next;}  _loop_only_once=0;  sleep
              _slideshow_sleep_time;  as a first command. Can be interrupted by : or Esc. The other keys execute accordingly to their function but do not interrupt the  slideshow.
              Like in fbi, this cycles forever, unless --once is specified.

       --sanity-check
              Perform a quick sanity check, just after the initialization, and terminate.

       -t, --no-framebuffer
              fim  Use an ASCII Art driver. If present, use either of libcaca (coloured), or aalib (monochrome). For more, see (man fimrc), (info aalib) or (apropos caca)).  If no
              ASCII Art driver had been enabled at compile time, fim does not display any image at all.

       -T {terminal}, --vt {terminal}
              The {terminal} is to be used as virtual terminal device file (as in fbi).  See (chvt (1)), (openvt (1)) for more info about this.  Use (con2fb (1)) to map a terminal
              to a framebuffer device.

       --reverse
              Reverse files list before browsing (can be combined with the other sorting options).

       --sort Sort files list before browsing according to full filename.

       --sort-basename
              Sort files list before browsing according to file basename's.

       --sort-mtime
              Sort files list before browsing according to file modification time.

       --sort-fsize
              Sort files list before browsing according to file size.

       -u, --random
              Randomly shuffle the files list before browsing (seed depending on time() function).

       --random-no-seed
              Pseudo-random shuffle the files list before browsing (no seeding).

       -v, --verbose
              Be verbose: show status bar.

       --verbose-load
              Load files verbosely (repeat option to increase verbosity).

       --verbose-font-load
              Load font verbosely (sets _fbfont_verbosity).

       --verbose-interpreter
              Execute interpreter verbosely (Sets immediately _debug_commands="ackCm" if specified once, _debug_commands="ackCmmi" if specified  twice).

       -V, --version
              Print to stdout program version, compile flags, enabled features, linked libraries information, supported filetypes/file loaders, and then exit.

       -w, --autowidth
              Scale the image according to the screen width.

       -=, --no-auto-scale
              Do not scale the images after loading (sets '_scale_style=" "';).

       --autowindow
              Resize the window size (if supported by the video mode) to the image size. Don't use this with other image scaling options.

       --no-stat-push
              Sets _push_checks=0 before initialization, thus disabling file/dir existence checks with stat(2) at push push time (and speeding up startup).

       -H, --autoheight
              Scale the image according to the screen height.

       -W {scriptfile}, --write-scriptout {scriptfile}
              All  the characters that you type are recorded in the file {scriptfile}, until you exit fim.  This is useful if you want to create a script file to be used with "fim
              -c" or ":exec" (analogous to Vim's -s and ":source!").  If the {scriptfile} file exists, it is not touched (as in Vim's -w).

       -L {fileslistfile}, --read-from-file {fileslistfile}
              Read file list from a file: each line one file to load (similar to --read-from-stdin; use --read-from-stdin-elds to control line breaking).

        -, --read-from-stdin
              Read file list from stdin: each line one file to load; use with --read-from-stdin-elds to control line breaking).

              Note that these three standard input reading functionalities (-i,-p and -) conflict : if two or more of them occur in fim invocation, fim exits  with  an  error  and
              warn about the ambiguity.

              See the section INVOCATION EXAMPLES below to read some useful (and unique) ways of employing fim.

       --read-from-stdin-elds {delimiter-char}
              Specify  an  endline delimiter character for breaking lines read via -/--read-from-stdin/--read-from-file (which shall be specified after this). Line text before the
              delimiter are be treated as names of files to load; the text after is ignored. This is  also  useful  e.g.  to  load  description  files  (see  --load-image-descrip‐
              tions-file) as filename list files. Default is the newline character (0x0A); to specify an ASCII NUL byte (0x00) use ''.

       -A, --autotop
              Align images to the top border (by setting '_autotop=1' after initialization).

       -q, --quiet
              Quiet execution mode. Sets _display_status=0;_display_busy=0;.

       -r {{width:height}|'fullscreen'}, --resolution {{width:height}|'fullscreen'}
              Set  resolution  specification in pixels dimensions. Supported only by GTK and SDL. Will be appended to the argument to --output-device. Shorthand value 'fullscreen'
              is translated as 'W'.

       -R[{exp}], --recursive[={exp}]
              Push      files/directories      to      the      files      list      recursively.      The      expression      in       variable       _pushdir_re       (default:
              ".(JPG|PNG|GIF|BMP|TIFF|TIF|JPEG|JFIF|PPM|PGM|PBM|PCX|QOI|AVIF|WEBP)$")  lists  extensions  of filenames which are loaded in the list. You can overwrite its value by
              optionally passing an expression {exp} here as argument. If starting with '+' or '|', the expression following is to be appended to it.

       -X, --no-pipe-load
              Do not load via external converter programs: only use built-in file decoders.

       -B, --background-recursive
              Push files/directories to the files list recursively, in background during program execution. Any sorting options are ignored. Experimental feature, unfinished.

       --load-shadow-directory {dirname}
              Add {dirname} to the shadow directory list. Then 'scale "shadow"' temporarily substitutes the image being displayed with that of the first  same-named  file  located
              under a shadow directory. Useful to browse low-res images, but still being able to quickly view the hi-res original residing in a shadow directory. This works as in‐
              tended as long as unique filenames are involved.

       -/ {pattern}, --/ {pattern}
              After startup jump to pattern; short for -c '/' {pattern}.

       --// {pattern}
              After startup jump to pattern; as -c '/'{pattern} but with search on the full path (with _re_search_opts="f").

       -1, --once
              If running --slideshow, loop only once (as in fbi).

PROGRAM RETURN STATUS
       The program return status is 0 on correct operation; 252 on unsupported device specification; 248 on bad input; 255 on a generic error; 42  on  a  signal-triggered  program
       exit;  or a different value in case of an another error.
        The return status may be controlled by the use of the quit command.

COMMON KEYS AND COMMANDS
       The following keys and commands are default hardcoded in the minimal configuration. These are working by default before any configuration file loading, and before the hardcoded config loading (see variable _fim_default_config_file_contents).

        n    goto '+1f'
        p    goto '-1f'
        +    scale '+'
        -    scale '-'
        h    pan 'left'
        l    pan 'right'
        k    pan 'up-'
        j    pan 'down+'
        q    quit
       You can type a number before a command binding to iterate the assigned command:
       3k    3pan 'up-'

       :       enter command line mode (here one can use readline bindings as C-r, C-s, M-b, M-f, ...)
       :{number}       jump to {number}^th image in the list
       :^           jump to first image in the list
       :$           jump to last image in the list
       :*{factor}      scale the image by {factor}
       :{scale}%       scale the image to the desired {scale}
       :+{scale}%       scale the image up to the desired percentage {scale} (relatively to the original)
       :-{scale}%       scale the image down to the desired percentage {scale} (relatively to the original)

       /{regexp}       entering the pattern {regexp} (with '/') makes fim jump to the next image whose filename matches {regexp}
       /*.png$         entering this pattern (with '/') makes fim jump to the next image whose filename ends with 'png'
       /png       a shortcut for '/.*png.*'

       2,4 stdout '{}'     print three filenames to standard output.

       !{syscmd}      executes the {syscmd} quoted string as an argument to the  "system" fim command.

       You can visualize all of the default bindings invoking fim --dump-default-fimrc | grep bind .
       You can visualize all of the default aliases invoking fim  --dump-default-fimrc | grep alias .

       The Return vs. Space key thing can be used to create a file list while reviewing the images and use the list for batch processing later on.

       All of the key bindings are reconfigurable; see the default fimrc file for examples on this, or read the complete manual: the FIM.TXT file distributed with fim.

AFFECTING ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       FBFONT         (just like in fbi) a Linux consolefont font file.
       If using a gzipped font file, the zcat program is used to uncompress it (via execvp(3)).
       If FBFONT is unset, the following files are probed and the first existing one is selected:

       /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/cp866-8x16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/Uni3-TerminusBoldVGA14.psf.gz
       /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat9-16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf
       /usr/share/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/lat1-16.psfu.gz
       /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf
       /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psfu.gz
       /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf
       /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf.gz
       /usr/lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psfu.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psf.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/lat1-16.psfu.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/Lat2-VGA14.psf.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/Lat2-VGA16.psf.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/Lat2-VGA8.psf.gz
       /lib/kbd/consolefonts/Uni2-VGA16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/default8x16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/default8x9.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/Lat15-Fixed16.psf.gz
       /usr/share/consolefonts/default.psf.gz
       fim://

       If the special fim:// string is specified, a hardcoded font is used.
       FBGAMMA        (just like in fbi) gamma correction (applies to dithered 8 bit mode only). Default is 1.0.
       FRAMEBUFFER    (just like in fbi) user set framebuffer device file (applies only to the fb mode).
       If unset, fim probes for /dev/fb0.
       TERM      (only in fim) influences the output device selection algorithm, especially if $TERM=="screen".
       SSH_TTY   if set and no output device specified, assume we're over ssh, and give precedence to ca, then aa (if present).
       TERMUX_VERSION if set and no output device specified, assume we're over termux, and give precedence to ca, then aa (if present).
       WAYLAND_DISPLAY     if set and no output device specified, assume we're over Wayland, and give precedence to gtk, then sdl, then ca, then aa (if present).
       DISPLAY   If this variable is set, then the gtk driver has precedence, then sdl.

COMMON PROBLEMS
       fim  -o  fb needs read-write access to the framebuffer devices (/dev/fbN or /dev/fb/N), i.e you (our your admin) have to make sure fim can open the devices in rw mode.  The
       IMHO most elegant way is to use pam_console (see /etc/security/console.perms) to chown the devices to the user logged in on the console.  Another  way  is  to  create  some
       group,  chown  the  special files to that group and put the users which are allowed to use the framebuffer device into the group.  You can also make the special files world
       writable, but be aware of the security implications this has.  On a private box it might be fine to handle it this way through.

       If using udev, you can edit: /etc/udev/permissions.d/50-udev.permissions and set these lines like here:
        # fb devices
        fb:root:root:0600
        fb[0-9]*:root:root:0600
        fb/*:root:root:0600

       fim -o fb also needs access to the linux console (i.e. /dev/ttyN) for sane console switch handling.  That is obviously no problem for console logins, but any kind of pseudo
       tty (xterm, ssh, screen, ...) will not work.

INVOCATION EXAMPLES
       fim --help -R -B
       # get help for options -R and -B

       fim media/
       # load files from the directory media/

       fim -R media/ --sort
       # open files found by recursive traversal of directory media, then sorting the list

       find /mnt/media/ -name *.jpg | fim -
       # read input files list from standard input

       find /mnt/media/ -name *.jpg | shuf | fim -
       # read input files list from standard input, randomly shuffled

       cat script.fim | fim -p images/*
       # read a script file script.fim from standard input before displaying files in the directory images

       scanimage ... | tee scan.ppm | fim -i
       # read the image scanned from a flatbed scanner as soon as it is read

       h5topng -x 1 -y 2 dataset.hdf -o /dev/stdout | fim -i
       # visualize a slice from an HDF5 dataset file

       fim * > selection.txt
       # output the file names marked interactively with the 'list "mark"' command in fim to a file

       fim * | fim -
       # output the file names marked with 'm' in fim to a second instance of fim, in which these could be marked again

       fim -c 'pread "vgrabbj -d /dev/video0 -o png";reload'
       # display an image grabbed from a webcam

       fim -o aa -c 'pread "vgrabbj -d /dev/video0 -o png";reload;system "fbgrab" "asciime.png"'
       # if running in framebuffer mode, saves a png screenshot with an ASCII rendering of an image grabbed from a webcam

       fim -c 'while(1){pread "vgrabbj -d /dev/video0 -o png";reload;sleep 1;};'

       # display a sequence of images grabbed from a webcam; circa 1 per second

NOTES
       This manual page is neither accurate nor complete. In particular, issues related to driver selection shall be described more accurately. Also the accurate sequence of auto‐
       commands execution, variables application is critical to understanding fim, and should be documented.  The filename "<STDIN>" is reserved for images read from standard  in‐
       put (view this as a limitation), and thus handling files with such name may incur in limitations.

BUGS
       fim  has  bugs. Please read the BUGS file shipped in the documentation directory to discover the known ones.  There are also inconsistencies in the way the internal command
       line works across the different graphical devices.

FILES
       /usr/local/share/doc/fim
                      The directory with fim documentation files.

       /usr/local/etc/fimrc
                      The system-wide fim initialization file (executed at startup, after executing the hardcoded configuration).

       ~/.fimrc       The personal fim initialization file (executed at startup, after the system-wide initialization file).

       ~/.fim_history File where to load from or save command history. See (man fimrc(5),  man readline(3)).

       ~/.inputrc     If fim is built with GNU readline support, it is susceptible to changes in the user set ~/.inputrc configuration file contents.  For details, see (man  read‐
                      line(3)).
