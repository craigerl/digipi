DESCRIPTION
       This  page  explains the fim scripting language, which is used for the fimrc configuration files, {scriptfile}s, or {commands} passed via command line {options}.  This lan‐
       guage can be used to issue commands (or programs) from the internal program command line accessed interactively by default through the ":" key (which can be customized  via
       the  "_console_key"  variable).  One may exit from command line mode by pressing the Enter key on an empty line (a non empty command line would be submitted for execution),
       or the Esc key  (only in SDL mode).  The general form of a fim command/program is shown in the next section.

FIM LANGUAGE GRAMMAR
       This section specifies the grammar of the fim language.

       Language elements surrounded by a single quote ("'") are literals.

       Warning: at the present state, this grammar has conflicts. A future release shall fix them.

                   | UNQUOTED_FLOAT
                   | STRING

       A STRING can be either a single quoted string or a double quoted string.  A floating point number can be either  unquoted  (UNQUOTED_FLOAT)  or  quoted  (QUOTED_FLOAT).   A
       QUOTED_FLOAT  is  a  floating  point number, either single ("'") or double (""") quoted.  An INTEGER shall be an unsigned integer number.  An IDENTIFIER shall be one of the
       valid fim commands (see COMMANDS REFERENCE ) or a valid alias.  A VARIABLE shall be an already declared or undeclared variable identifier (see VARIABLES REFERENCE  )  or  a
       valid  alias,  created  using the alias command.  The "=~" operator treats the right expression as a STRING, and uses it as a regular expression for matching purposes.  The
       SLASH_AND_REGEXP is a slash ("/") followed by a STRING, interpreted as a regular expression.  If 'INTEGER , INTEGER IDENTIFIER arguments' is encountered, command IDENTIFIER
       will  be  repeated  on  each  file in the interval between the two INTEGERs, and substituting the given file name to any '{}' found in the commands arguments (which must be
       quoted in order to be treated as strings).  See regex(1) for regular expression syntax.

       The way some one-line statements are evaluated:

       :       enter command line mode (here one can use readline bindings as C-r, C-s, M-b, M-f, ...)
       :{number}       jump to {number}^th image in the list
       :^           jump to first image in the list
       :$           jump to last image in the list
       :*{factor}      scale the image by {factor}
       :{scale}%       scale the image to the desired {scale}
       :+{scale}%       scale the image up to the desired percentage {scale} (relatively to the original)
       :-{scale}%       scale the image down to the desired percentage {scale} (relatively to the original)

       /{regexp}       entering the pattern {regexp} (with '/') makes fim jump to the next image whose filename matches {regexp}
       /*.png$         entering this pattern (with '/') makes fim jump to the next image whose filename ends with 'png'
       /png       a shortcut for '/.*png.*'

       2,4 stdout '{}'     print three filenames to standard output.

       !{syscmd}      executes the {syscmd} quoted string as an argument to the  "system" fim command.

COMMANDS REFERENCE
       alias
       alias [{identifier} [{commands} [{description}]]]
       Without arguments, lists the current aliases.
       With one, shows an identifier's assigned command.
       With two, assigns to an identifier a user defined command or sequence of commands.
       With three, also assigns a help string.

       align
       align ['bottom'|'top'|'left'|right']: if image larger than drawing area, align one side of the image to the border.
       align 'center': align equally far from all sides.
       align 'info': print internal alignment information.

       autocmd
       autocmd {event} {pattern} {commands}: manipulate autocommands (inspired from Vim autocmd's).
       Without arguments, list autocommands.
       With arguments, specifies for which type of event and which current file open, which commands to execute.
       See the default built-in configuration files for examples.

       autocmd_del
       autocmd_del: specify autocommands to delete.
       Usage: autocmd_del {event} {pattern} {commands}.

       basename
       basename {filename}: returns the basename of {filename} in the '_last_cmd_output' variable.

       bind
       bind [{keysym} [{commands} [{description}]]]: bind a key {keysym} to {commands}.
       Optional {description} specifies a documentation string.
       If {keysym} is at least two characters long and begins with 0 (zero), the integer number after the 0 will be treated as a raw keycode to bind the specified {keysym} to.
       Use the '_verbose_keys' variable to discover (display device dependent) raw keys.
       Key binding is dynamical, so you can bind keys even during program's execution.
       You can get a list of valid symbols (keysyms) by invoking dump_key_codes or in the man page.

       cd
       cd {path}: change the current directory to {path}.
       If {path} is a file, use its base directory name.
       cd '-' changes to the previous current directory (before the last ':cd {path}' command).

       clear
       clear: clear the virtual console.

       commands
       commands: display the existing commands.

       color
       color ['desaturate']: desaturate the displayed image colors.
       color ['negate']: negate the displayed image colors.
       color ['colorblind'|'c'|'deuteranopia'|'d']: simulate a form of the deuteranopia color vision deficiency (cvd).
       color ['protanopia'|'p']: simulate a form of the protanopia cvd.
       color ['tritanopia'|'t']: simulate a form of the tritanopia cvd.
       color ['daltonize'|'D']: if following a cvd specification, attempts correcting it.
       color ['identity']: populate the image with 'RGB identity' pixels.
       To get back the original, you have to reload the image.

       crop
       crop: crop image to a centered rectangle, half the width and half the height.
       crop {p}: crop image to the middle {p} horizontal percent and {p} vertical percent of the image.
       crop {w} {h}: crop image to the middle {w} horizontal percent and {h} vertical percent of the image.
       crop {x1} {y1} {x2} {y2}: crop image to the area between the upper left ({x1},{y1}) and lower right ({x2},{y2}) corner.
       Units are intended as percentage (0 to 100).
       Note: still experimental functionality.

       desc
       desc 'load' {filename} [{sepchar}]: load description file {filename}, using the optional {sepchar} character as separator.
       desc 'reload': load once again description files specified at the command line with --load-image-descriptions-file, with respective separators.
       desc ['-all'] ['-append'] ['-nooverw'] 'save' {filename} [{sepchar}]: save current list descriptions to file {filename}, using the optional {sepchar} character as separa‐
       tor, and if '-all' is present then save the variables, and if '-append' is present then only append, and if '-nooverw' is present then do not overwrite existing files.
       See documentation of --load-image-descriptions-file for the format of {filename}.

       display
       display ['reinit' {string} | 'resize' {w} {h} | ['menuadd' {menuspec}|'menudel'|'v'|'V'] ]: display the current file contents or change display settings.
       If 'reinit' switch is supplied, the {string} specifier is used to reinitialize the display device parameters like e.g. resolution, window system options; see the --out‐
       put-device command line switch for allowed values.
       If 'resize' and no argument, ask the window manager to resize the window like the image.
       If 'resize' and two arguments, these are used to reset width and height of the current window.
       In the 'menuadd' case, use {menuspec} as GTK window menu specification. This specification string argument can be repeated. Each argument has form M/S. M is a slash-sepa‐
       rated submenu location, with optional '_' (underscore) before a GTK accelerator character (e.g. "File", "_File", "View/Scale", "_View/Scale"). M cannot be empty and must be
       followed by a '/'. S can specify a simple entry, a toggle entry, or radio buttons. If a simple entry, it consists of one to three sections separated by "  " (two spaces).
       If M begins with two non-alphanumeric symbols, these will be used as separators, instead of the two spaces. The first section is the name of the menu entry (a label), the
       second is a command specification, the third is a shortcut character. The following labels are special and if followed by '/', they create custom menus: FimMenuLimit
       (pre-categorized "limit"-based commands based on actual "desc" command data), FimMenuCommands (with commands), FimMenuAliases (with aliases), FimMenuKeyBindings (with bind‐
       ings), FimMenuVariables (with variables' values), FimMenuCommandsHelp (commands help), FimMenuAliasesHelp (aliases help), FimMenuKeyBindingsHelp (bindings help), FimMenu‐
       VariablesHelp (variables' help). A toggle button specification can take the form 'toggle__'{identifier}'__'{value}'__'{value} and starts the toggle button with the second
       {value} (which has to be different). Actually, between 'toggle' and the second value, instead of '__' you can use any two same punctuation signs or Tab characters consis‐
       tently. E.g. "menu/label  toggle___v__1__2  " or "menu/label  toggle::_v::1::2  " are ok, but  "menu/label  toggle___v__1__1  " or "menu/label  toggle___v::1::2  " are not.
       A radio buttons specification has as many sections as radio buttons, separated internally by double spaces, and consisting each by a string, two spaces, an assignment
       {identifier}={value} (notice no quotes are necessary around {value}, and repetitions are illegal), two spaces, and an optional accelerator character (e.g. "m/first:  v=1  a
       second:  v=2  b  third:  v=3  c" is ok, but "m/first:  v=1  a  second:  v=2  b  third:  v=2  c" is not).
       Option 'menudel' removes all menus.
       Note: 'menuadd' and 'menudel' are only valid for the gtk mode and are experimental. In particular, currently there are limitations on which characters are allowed in menu
       command specifications; the recommended workaround is to use aliases.
       Experimental option 'v' increases internal verbosity for some graphical outputs; experimental option 'V' decreases it.
       See also the '_debug_commands' variable.

       dump_key_codes
       dump_key_codes: dump the active key codes (unescaped, for inspection purposes).

       echo
       echo {args}: print the {args} on console.

       else
       if(expression){action;}['else'{action;}]: see if.

       eval
       eval {args}: evaluate {args} as commands, executing them.

       exec
       exec {filename(s)}: execute script {filename(s)}.

       font
       font 'scan' [{dirname}]: scan {dirname} or /usr/share/consolefonts looking for fonts in the internal fonts list.
       font 'load' {filename}: load font {filename}.
       font {'next'|'prev'}: load next or previous font from the internal fonts list.
       font 'info': print current font filename.

       getenv
       getenv {identifier}: create a variable with the same value as the '{identifier}' environment variable, but with an identifier prefixed by 'ENV_'. So e.g. getenv 'DISPLAY'
       creates 'ENV_DISPLAY'. Nothing is being printed; no variable is created if {identifier} is empty.

       goto
       goto {['+'|'-']{number}['%']['f'|'p'|'F'|'P']}+ | {/{regexp}/} | {?{filename}} | {'+//'} | {'+/'|'-/'}[C] | {{'+'|'-'}{identifier}['+']}: jump to an image.
       If {number} is given, and not surrounded by any specifier, go to image at index {number}.
       If followed by '%', the effective index is computed as a percentage to the current available images.
       If prepended by '-' or '+', the jump is relative to the current index.
       The 'f' specifier asks for the jump to occur within the files (same for 'F', but accelerates if keep pressing).
       The 'p' specifier asks for the jump to occur in terms of pages, within the current file (same for 'P', but accelerates if keep pressing).
       If there's only one file in the list and no 'f' specified, a 'p' will be implied, for a page jump.
       The above form can be concatenated several times, but only the last occurrence of either file or page goto will be effective.
       If /{regexp}/ is given, jump to the first image matching the given /{regexp}/ regular expression pattern.
       If the argument starts with ?, jump to the filename following ?.
       If given '+//', jump to the first different image matching the last given regular expression pattern.
       With '+/'C or '-/'C, jump to the next or the previous file according to C: if 's' if same directory, if 'd' if down the directory hierarchy, if 'u' if down the directory
       hierarchy, if 'b' if same basename, if upper case match is negative, if missing defaults to 'S' (jump to file in different dir).
       If {identifier|identifier2...}] is encountered after a '+' or '-' sign, jump to the next or the previous image having a different value for any corresponding i:{identifier}
       (a trailing '+' requires a non empty value).
       Matching can occur on both file name and description, possibly loaded via desc or --load-image-descriptions-file; see also '_lastgotodirection' and '_re_search_opts'.
        You can specify multiple arguments to goto: those after the first one triggering a jump are ignored.
       Executes autocommands for events PreGoto and PostGoto. Keeping pressed shall accelerate images browsing.

       help
       help [{identifier}]: provide online help, assuming {identifier} is a variable, alias, or command identifier.
       If {identifier} begins with '/', search on the help contents, and show a list of matching items.
       A list of commands can be obtained simply invoking 'commands'; a list of aliases with 'alias'; a list of bindings with 'bind'; a list of variables with 'variables'.

       if
       if(expression){action;}['else'{action;}]: see 'else'.

       info
       info: display information about the current file.

       limit
       limit  {'-list'|'-listall'} 'variable'|['-further'|'-merge'|'-subtract'] [{expression} |{variable} {value}]: A browsable file list filtering function (like limiting in the
       'mutt' program). Uses information loaded via --load-image-descriptions-file.
        If invoked with '-list'/'-listall' only, will list the current description variable ids.
        If invoked with '-list'/'-listall' 'id', will list set values for the variable 'id'.
        If '-further' is present, will start with the current list; if not, with the full list.
        If '-merge' is present, new matches will be merged in the existing list and sorted.
        If '-subtract' is present, sort and filter out matches.
        If {variable} and {value} are provided, limit to files having property {variable} set to {value}.
        If {expression} is one exclamation point ('!'), will limit to the currently marked files only.
        If {expression} is '~!' will limit to files with unique basename.
        if '~=', to files with duplicate basename.
        if '~^', to the first of the files with duplicate basename.
        if '~$', to the last of the files with duplicate basename.
        On '~i' [MINIDX][-][MAXIDX], (each a number possibly followed by a multiplier 'K') will limit on filenames in position MINIDX to MAXIDX.
        On '~z' will limit to files having the current file's size.
        on '~z' [MINSIZE][-][MAXSIZE], (each a number possibly followed by a multiplier among 'k','K','m','M') will limit on filesize within these limits.
        on '~d' will limit to files having the current file's date +- one day.
        on '~d' [MINTIME][-][MAXTIME], (each the count of seconds since the Epoch (First of Jan. of 1970) or a date as DD/MM/YYYY) will limit on file time (struct stat's
       'st_mtime', in seconds) within this interval.
        For other values of {expression}, limit to files whose description string matches {expression}.
        Invoked with no arguments, the original browsable files list is restored.

       list
       list: display the files list.
       list 'random_shuffle': randomly shuffle the file list.
       list 'reverse': reverse the file list.
       list 'clear': clear the file list.
       list 'sort': sort the file list.
       list 'sort_basename': sort the file list according to base name.
       list 'sort_comment': sort the file list according to the value of the _comment variable.
       list 'sort_var' {var}: sort the file list according to the value of the i:{var} variable.
       list 'vars'|'variables': list variables in all i:* read from description file.
       list 'sort_fsize': sort the file list according to file size.
       list 'sort_mtime': sort the file list according to modification date.
       list 'pop': remove the current file from the files list, and step back.
       list 'remove' [{filename(s)}]: remove the current file, or the {filename(s)}, if specified.
       list 'push' {filename(s)}: push {filename(s)} to the back of the files list.
       list 'filesnum': display the number of files in the files list.
       list 'mark' [{args}]: mark image file names for stdout printing at exit, with {args} mark the ones matching according to the rules of the 'limit' command, otherwise the
       current file.
       list 'unmark' [{args}]: unmark marked image file names, with {args} unmark the ones matching according to the rules of the 'limit' command, otherwise the current file.
       list 'marked': show which files have been marked so far.
       list 'dumpmarked': dump to stdout the marked files (you usually want to 'unmarkall' afterwards).
       list 'markall': mark all the current list files.
       list 'unmarkall': unmark all the marked files.
       list 'pushdir' {dirname}: push all the files in {dirname}, when matching the regular expression in variable _pushdir_re or, if empty, from constant regular expression
       '.(JPG|PNG|GIF|BMP|TIFF|TIF|JPEG|JFIF|PPM|PGM|PBM|PCX|QOI|AVIF|WEBP)$'.
       list 'pushdirr' {dirname}: like pushdir, but also push encountered directory entries recursively.
       list 'swap': move the current image filename to the first in the list (you'll have to invoke reload to see the effect).
       Of the above commands, several are temporarily not available for the duration of a background load (enabled by --background-recursive), which lasts until _loading_in_back‐
       ground is 0.

       load

       _orientation [internal,i:] Orthogonal clockwise rotation (orientation) is controlled by: 'i:_orientation', 'g:_orientation' and applied on a per-image basis. In particular,
       the values of the three variables are summed up and the sum is interpreted as the image orientation.  If the sum is 0, no rotation applies; if it is 1, a single ( 90') ro‐
       tation applies; if it is 2, a double (180') rotation applies; if it is 3, a triple (270') rotation applies.  If the sum is not one of 0,1,2,3, the value of the sum modulo 4
       is considered.  Therefore, ":i:_orientation=1" and ":i:_orientation=5" are equivalent: they rotate the image one time by 90'.

       _push_checks [in,experimental,g:] if 1 (default), check with stat() the existence of input files before push'ing them (set this to 0 to speed up loading very long file
       lists; in these cases a trailing slash (/) must be used to tell fim a pathname is a directory). This only works after initialization (thus, after command line files have
       been push'ed); use --no-stat-push if you wish to set this to 0 at command line files specification.
       _push_pushes_dirs [in,g:] if 1, the push command also accepts and pushes directories (using pushdir). if 2, also push hidden files/directories, that is, ones whose names

       _pwd [out,g:] the current working directory; variable updated at startup and whenever the working directory changes.
       _re_search_opts [in,g:] affects regexp-based searches; if an empty string, defaults apply; if it contains 'i' ('I'), case insensitive (sensitive) searches occur; if it con‐
       tains 'b', match on basename, if contains 'f' on full pathname; if it contains 'D', match on description.

       _screen_height [out] the screen height.
       _screen_width [out,g:] the screen width.
       _scroll_skip_page_fraction [int,g:] if >1, fraction of page to skip when scrolling (e.g. 'scrollforward'); if 1, auto chosen; if <1, disabled.

       _sys_rc_file [in,g:] string with the global configuration file name.
       _use_exiftool [in,g:] if >0 and supported, use exiftool to get additional information. If 1, append this information to _comment; if 2, to _exiftool_comment.
       _use_mipmaps [in,g:] if >0, use mipmaps to speed up downscaling of images (this has a memory overhead equivalent to one image copy); mipmaps are not cached. If 2, use every
       fourth source pixel instead of averaging (good for photos, not for graphs).
       _verbose_errors [in,g:] if 1, display on stdout internal errors, while parsing commands.
       _verbose_keys [in,g:] if 1, display on the console the raw keycode of each key hit interactively.
       _verbosity [in,experimental,g:] program verbosity.
       _vsteps [in,g:] the default steps, in pixels, when panning images vertically (overrides steps).
       _want_autocenter [in,g:] if 1, center the image when displayed.
       _want_exif_orientation [in,g:] if 1, reorient images using information from EXIF metadata (and stored in in _exif_orientation, __exif_mirrored, __exif_flipped ).
       _want_prefetch [in,g:] if 1, prefetch further files just after displaying the first file; if 2 (and configured with --enable-cxx11) load in the background.
       _want_wm_caption_status [in,g:] this works only if supported by the display device. If set to a number that is not 0, show the status (or command) line in the window man‐
       ager caption; if set to a non-empty string, interpret it just as a file info format string (see _info_fmt_str); if empty, show the program version.
       _want_wm_mouse_ctrl [in,g:] if at least 9 chars long, enable mouse click/movement behaviour when in GTK, SDL or libcaca mode; the 9 chars correspond to a 3x3 screen click‐
       able grid and the equivalent command keys; clicking middle or right button toggle on-screen usage info.
       angle [in,out,i:] a floating point number specifying the rotation angle, in degrees.
       ascale [in,out,i:] the asymmetric scaling of the current image.
       desaturated [out,i:] 1, if the image is desaturated.
       flipped [out,i:] 1, if the image is flipped.
       fresh [in,out,i:,experimental] 1 if the image was loaded, before all autocommands (autocmd) execution.
       height [out,i:] the current image original height.
       mirrored [out,i:] 1, if the image is mirrored.
       negated [out,i:] 1, if the image is negated.
       page [out,experimental,g:] the current page.
       pages [out,experimental,i:] the current number of pages of an image.
       random [out] a pseudorandom number.
       scale [in,i:] the scale of the current image.
       sheight [out,i:] the current image scaled height.
       swidth [out,i:] the current image scaled width.
       width [out,i:] the current image original width.

DEFAULT ALIASES REFERENCE
       Hardcoded aliases are:

       alias "A" "_autotop=1-_autotop;"
       alias "magnify" "scale '+'" # magnify the displayed image by the _magnify_factor variable or {args}
       alias "next" "goto '+1'" # go to the next page or file
       alias "next_file" "goto '+1f'" # go to the next file in the list
       alias "next_page" "goto '+1p'" # go to the next page in the file
       alias "prev" "goto '-1'" # go to the previous page or file
       alias "prev_file" "goto '-1f'" # go to the previous file in the list
       alias "prev_page" "goto '-1p'" # go to the previous page in the file
       alias "reduce" "scale '-'" # reduce the displayed image by _reduce_factor or {args}
       alias "scale_factor_decrease" "scale '+-'" # subtract _scale_factor_delta to the scale factors _reduce_factor and _magnify_factor
       alias "scale_factor_grow" "scale '+*'" # multiply the scale factors _reduce_factor and _magnify_factor by _scale_factor_multiplier
       alias "scale_factor_increase" "scale '++'" # add _scale_factor_delta to the scale factors _reduce_factor and _magnify_factor
       alias "scale_factor_shrink" "scale '+/'" # divide the scale factors _reduce_factor and _magnify_factor by _scale_factor_multiplier

       They can be redefined with alias or deleted with the unalias command.
       Further default aliases are usually loaded at startup -- see the CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE section below.

COMMAND LINE USAGE EXAMPLES
       # jump to the third image:
       3;
       # jump to first image:
       ^;
       # jump to last image:
       $;
       # magnify the image two times:
       *2;
       # scale the image to the 30% of the original:
       30%;
       # scale the image up by 30%:
       +30%;
       # scale the image down by 30%:
       -30%;
       # jump to the next image whose filename matches the ".*jpg" regular expression:
       /.*jpg;
       # execute the "date" system command
       !"date";

CONFIGURATION FILE EXAMPLE
       Part of the default configuration comes from the _fim_default_config_file_contents variable, shown here.
       One can skip its loading by using the _no_default_configuration variable.
