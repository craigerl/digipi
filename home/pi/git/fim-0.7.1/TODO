20111008	decouple strings location from executable (e.g.: allow for a memory-mapped help/strings file)
20111005	imlib2 shall be suggested among devices on device fail. on hlst3, 'w' rendering bug. screen-patch should be optional at runtime when selecting the fbdev device

20110909	tty control stuff (e.g.:saved_attributes_) shall be compile time optional
20110907	vedi liburiparser
20110904	buffering stdin/whatever shall be tmpname/fd backed

20110831	insert macros here and there for random or controlled error injection
20110831	whenever possible, error strings shall be printed out escaped; if not possible, this should be reported.
20110831	program return codes should reflect failure reason (e.g.: generic unspecified, input, internal, device, memory exhaustion, etc)
20110830	should provide some statistics/microbenchmarks; e.g.: pixels/s in resize, or bytes/s in disk I/O, etc.
20110830	write an 'interruptible' interface for heavier functions
20110830	very big files should be allowed to be read with no big copy 
20110830	smaller files should be allowed to be read with copy (so, a single from-disk copy)

20110824	need statistics on memory usage, from within fim.
20110824	need help [ "grep" | "find" ]
20110823	need to interface to zip.h and libzip -- and define a 'buffered', or 'virtual' files abstraction

20110817	need macros to check for allowed width/height/bpp/... values
20110816	fim.h should be an #include-only container !
20110816	repeat should become a standard argument of commands
20110801	is there a way to make fim load . if no file is specified ?
20110801	a pensarci bene, bottoni in sdl mode non sono poi cosi' impossibili
20110724	program 'fimtutor' as 'fim --tutorial'
20110724	Ctrl-C shall prompt for quitting (or optionally, quit), interrupting any interruptible task
20110724	allow plugins which can only load metainfo (user variables) from under-loading files  (e.g.: plugins using specialized libraries)
20110713	semi-colons terminating commands can be misleading 
20110713	parse errors should be verbose
20110713	dez@nino:~ $ fim -c 'variables;stdout _last_system_output;quit'
20110711	autocompletion of varname = <unescaped variable value>  would be both cool and useful
20110711	shall give the user chance to specify the position of an autocommand (e.g.: -1, +1, etc) within the current autocommands list
20110711	shall give the user chance to push dirs contents sorted
20110709	need to write to fim-users mentioning the ChangeLog and the solved bugs
20110709	grep .. | sed .. | fim_h_autocmds.h
20110709	grep .. | sed .. | fim_h_error_codes.h
20110709	grep .. | sed .. | fim_h_variables.h
20110711	may use ESC as a readline-exiting key
20110702	bind '\\' 'scale "100%"'; # is not accepted; this is bad

20110623	2. does not work
20110623	one may add :{+number} 
20110623	missing :+//
20110622	test7 was modified to work after some horrible page/cache hacks. consider rewriting the test
20110622	the cache/goto code now is a complete mess (page-wise next interacts with cache)
20110622	shall fix the FIM_HORRIBLE_CACHE_INVALIDATING_HACK
20110620	the lock/unlock usage style in the SDL case may not be correct in many situations, leading to system lock errors
20110620	sdl is still flawed without an interactive shell underneath; libreadline used in non-callback mode uses the terminal, and this is bad (verify this by running from within nautilus scripts)
20110620	need a user friendly, self-uninstalling warning message on empty files list, on startup
20110620	tab based files autocompletion has problems (may show only partial results)
20110620	init feature-check routine with some regexp/regsubst functionality testing
20110621	shall expose a regexp substition command
20110619	need an option for non-name-based, but loader-based directory scanning

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation features/fixes:

20110129	incongruences in FIM.TXT: the system command is declared to be non active. this is wrong.
20090512 	TODO : implement a regexp-based search, to give the user hints. (20090512) (like vim's helpgrep, helpfind)
20090418	fimtutor

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major language clarity features/fixes:

20110620	many commands shall be documented conditionally
20110517	may consider distinguishing "options" from "variables", as vim does
20110507	need a special mention for special variables (and their namespaces), in the documentation
20070417	It has come the time to decide the future developments of Fim.
	A lot of doubts arose. Here they are:
	- integration of the command line completion with the lexer/parser, to gain consistency
	- decisions about the nature of the language:
	  - should the variables be accessed like Bash,Perl, or C?
	  - should strings exist?
	  - should arrays exist ?
	  - should types exist ?
	  - should boolean options exist (like in Vim's paste/nopaste) ?
	  - should multi (quad/..) options exist (like in Mutt) ?
	- could it be nice to attach options set to an image/browser (e.g.: 
	  autowidth in only a window in a multiwindow scenario )?
	- integration with external libraries/scripts/etc.. ?

	These issues need reflection and study of the practical and theoretical
	advantages/possibilities/limitations of the alternatives.
	Meanwhile, the current development effort will be focused on enhancing
	the existing code, possibly not adding features but enhancing the code
	structure and converting the odd Fbi code in elegant, or possibly more
	optimized, (especially the hacked, critical parts concerning mirroring
	and flipping! ) Fim code.
20070903	these features are currently going to be worked in the near future:
			- arbitrary long key sequence bindings (mutt-like)
			- shortcuts algebra for commands
			- parameter passing to commands 
			- variables scoped inside viewport (v:), window (w:), image (i: or l:), global (g:), script (s:)
			- (to study) lookup tables to string to integer token conversion of variable names 
			  (to gain speedup and increase variables impact)
			- (to study) active variables - variables triggering actions
			- vim like 'set', 'let', 'unlet' commands..

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor language clarity features/fixes:

20110615	scale_increment & co -> in the "default aliases" section
20110615	set_commandline_mode -> cmdline on ; set_interactive_mode -> cmdline off ; clear -> console [clear|info]

20110615	redisplay = display 'force' ; reload = load 'force'
20110615	info [size|width|...]
20110613	need a single variable for flip,mirror, and eventually rotation (e.g.:fmr90)
20110613	shall reintroduce many composite commands tokens (e.g.: "pan 'up'")
20110612	scrolldown,scrollforward -> [pan|scroll] forward|read
20110612	dump_key_codes -> dump key_codes|variables|commands|aliases

20110604	may consider usage of ffmpeg's libswscale for image scaling
20110615	collate/permute args in aliases (for ensuring primitive recursive computability, with some other features) ?
20110530	in some contexts, using libsvga (see http://www.svgalib.org/jay/beginners_guide/beginners_guide.html) may be interesting 
20110516	shall foresee a mechanism for `stacked decoding'of `container' files (e.g.: gz,tar,tar.gz,bz,...)
20110516	shall foresee support for dynamically lodaded modules, for a number of operations (e.g.: file decoding/loading using custom external programs or libraries); see also http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/dl-libraries.html
20110506	shall see libicu http://userguide.icu-project.org/, for internationalization/unicode
20110127	consider making the program ready for GNU gettext: http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/manual/gettext/index.html#Top
20110117	could develop a "stack of windows" idea, for zooming or such stuff.
20110108	use static_cast, for it is not ambiguous with conversions
20090512	argument to aliases
20080127	think about a multi-monitor strategy for a single instance of Fim: note that currently it is possible to specify a framebuffer device (therefore a monitor) via -d (--device)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor but tricky (time consuming) features/issues:

20110618	cd dir ; push /regexp/
20110617	may honour command line options parsing features of aalib 
20110521	autocompletion shall be escaped (for opening filenames containing quoting chars)
20110612	using up and down keys in / mode seems to recall general history, not search history (even in old fim revisions)!
20110615	'3g'-like interactive command ? right now, it will repeat 3 times 'g', but we may internally switch the while to a special argument
20110530	need some "emergency" command and/or mechanism for freeing/reclaiming memory (e.g.:caches, buffers)
20110507	the generated man output shall print out examples which are also a correctness test
20110202	DICOM integration ? see libmdc2-dev / man medcon
20110503	it would be cool to allow bindings valid in consolemode
20080430	find a way to catch the console signal C-s in fim in a way to make C-s bindable
20080313	make each cpp file include exactly the header files used
20080216	add textureview mode
20091214	consider using libmagic

20081230	multipage caching and prefetching support still missing
20080502	reintroduce X custom font support
20071127	fim -q --quiet, vs warning on first run ?
20071127	proposal of a 'cropped view' functionality to ease sequent joint pages reading
20080430	add support for probing/scanning in byte ranges in file systems/files for known image types
20070812	study the benefits of integration with libraries like:
		DirectFB : for a simpler driver and display mechanism
		SDL : to use X ( 20081018 : enable it at configure time with ./configure --enable-sdl )
		MXK : for fancy input devices and capabilities
		BOOST
		integrate with external libraries for image analysis (like ANIMAL)
20070812	integrate the freshmeat-submit script (now seems like the freshmeat api is broken)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor and easy (not time consuming) feature:

20110620	need an option for displaying the filename as a relative path	
20110601	shall use fim_byte_t instead of unsigned char's
20110523	shall use autocommands for printing out status messages on loading,prefetching,etc 
20110615	shall prepare thorough test cases for scale and page goto subcases
20110528	may introduce a push/pop mechanism for the status bar
20080430	use tmpfile() instead FIM_TMP_FILENAME 
20080414	to use mkstemp() in src/FbiStuff.cpp
20080414	introduce fim_fatal(), fim_warn(), fim_fail(), ...
20080414	use rand48, and more options on random behaviour
20091017	actually, postscript header can be optional for postscript rendering. shall we introduce forced ps rendering?
20090820	should offer EXIF data to fim displaying
20091004	should deny execution of sick things as 'alias "n" "n"'
20091004	scroll amount should be a string. e.g.: "20%","20",".2"
20091004	in book viewing mode (and a single loaded file), typing :N should jump to the N'th inner page : DOCUMENT THIS FEATURE
20091004	PostLoad -> PostFileRead
20090513	_seek_magic : if set, this pattern will be searched before going to the next image or seek_next {pattern} ?, associando ad Image l'offset .. (a' la multipage)
20090318	minicheck to detect wrong permissions on fb file ?!
20081228	marked pictures should have at least some asterisk and the user should be able to unmark them.
20080903	introduce a variable for handling centering style : sticky, proportional, smart, ... (see Viewport)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test & correctness oriented features:

20110620	use cpp instead of grep when autogenerating doc files
20110612	the parser should be strictly checked for leaks
20110612	need a runtime method for diverting stdout ? may ease debugging.
20110602	need a test for the goodness of the 'random' variable numbers.
20110516	invoking fim in sdl mode with very low resolutions/window sizes is crashy. this is bad.
20110515	shall preprocessor-conditionally catch std::exception's and cout'ing this info or activate some debug channel.
20110515	shall use clear() resize(0) instead of clear() alone (which does not resize arrays)

20110507	need a macro to avoid X == "" comparisons
20110129	all of the scripts/rc scripts should be tested for compliance

20110108	apply the 'explicit' keywords to constructors
20101007	the use find_key_for_bound_cmd() should be avoided in status line update 
20091220	consider distributing a font file or simply to embed a freely licensed one in the sources, with an eye on portability
20091116	write some miniprogram for debugging keyboard input.
20091004	pdf picture viewing is memory greedy - be it a leak ?

20090711	should develop some quick benchmark to evaluate some drawing operations (e.g.: blanking, color fill, etc)
20090603	fix Adobe CS3 created jpg files opening
20090530	        crop        = gTrue; // fix this
20090419	serious exception handling for out of memory conditions for push_back's and stuff
20090412	fbi bugs: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=fbi
20090404	could use dejagnu for interactive (keyboard interaction based) testing
		http://www.kegel.com/xgcc3/ng1.txt, although first tests with expect (http://expect.nist.gov/) showed it
		doesn't handle well input exchange with fim
20090318	static checkers ?
		stllint : aszt.inf.elte.hu/~gsd/s/cikkek/concepts/2006/GregorSchuppSPE05.pdf
		cppcheck : http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppcheck/
		using astyle for code readability ?
		could use flawfinder
20090305	moritz suggests fimgs with :
		src/fim -c 'autoheight=0;autowidth=0;v:auto_scale_v=0;'\
			'autocmd "PostRedisplay" "" "g:oscale=scale;";'\
			'autocmd "PostReload" "" "scale g:oscale.\"%\";";'     *pages*
20090223	http://www.cubewano.org/oink <- use this automated checker, as well as other tools, possibily at least for format string vulnerabilities
20090224	to test better, develop some simple string functions and f(){}, a=f(x,y) , f , f x y , in vim style if possible, regexp_search
20090212	fix problems deriving from missing binaries and stuff
20090110	write a test case with memory constraints (in a way to stress say, failing mallocs)
20090108	write a test for corrupt image resilience (testing skip functionalities)
20081229	write a malloc and calloc wrapper, for the future
20081221	get rid of designated initializers (-pedantic) for ISO-C++
20080509	very long strings in input may cause problems :)
20070812	examine fbi's weak points like http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/2203/ and fix them in Fim, if present.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor but not easy (time consuming) features:

20110516	shall enable building with SDL only, without using Unix syscalls.
20081227	http://www-masu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kakugawa/TeX-Guy/ for dvi support
20080908	pdflib would be a nice try to view pdf files from within fim, but multiple anonymous images should be supported

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Optimization related ideas:

20090213	rewrite the core in a way to avoid convert_line: there is a potentially big performance gain
20080826	refine and optimize the rotation mechanism into a smarter, smoother, rendering based one
20090108	write some multi-mode optimizing blitting code generating m4 macro

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentation related ideas:

20071230	UNIX domain sockets communication and multithreaded Fim
20071230	A decent Features section in the web site, from the top.
20071127	in-depth study of Vim documentation to uniform languages as much as possible
20071127	prepare a cookbook
20071127	inspiration : #  vim +':help eval'


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language related ideas:

20080502	find a syntactical solution for ;; handling (extra semicolons) in the parser
20080223	fine grain the grammar using whitespaces too
20080216	add a third optional argument to bind : a description
20071127	possible namespaces : 
	 w:... window variables
	 g:... global variables
	 l:... local  variables
	 s:... script variables
	 t:... tab    variables
	 v:... vim    variables 
20071127	functions, return status, stdout, stderr ?
20071025	introduce a namespace : 'e:', to get environment variables!
20070921	argument passing to aliases, bash like ?! or vim-like ? 
20070920	as much as possible of Vim's language intuitive syntax

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Debug related ideas:

20080414	follow -Weffc++ g++ flag guidelines, and -Werror
20080414	instead of malloc() to use calloc() and MALLOC_PERTURB, M_PERTURB on mallopt()
20080414	use mtrace() sometimes, MALLOC_TRACE=mout
20080414	use the dmalloc library (DMALLOC_OPTIONS), ElectricFence,
20080414	use valgrind
20080414	use mudflap library
20080414	compile with -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG for having a bug-aware C++ standard library
20080414	experiment with libsegfault, <execinfo.h>
20080414	use lint from time to time
20080414	to add scripts to check for memory leaks and related bugs and build problems,
		in a way contributors could run cron scripts with svn export / build capabilities

Optimization:

20070418	Got ~400% speedup on image display thanks to trivial changes in
	the drawing code : memset and memcpy instead of assignments, and a less
	trivial change by swapping RGB channels on loading time instead that on
	drawing time. The analysis was made with the gprof profiler, nicely.

Maybe one day me or some contributor will read 
	http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/ScOut/Publications/PaperInfo/sf05.html
	or
Example 4.14 of the Intel Architecture SW Manual Optimization explains how to
and find some useful idea.
use PSHUFLW,PSHUFW,PSHUFD to reverse contiguous words in registers.

This file is often outdated : Fim is far better than it seems here :)

Please read the FIM.TXT file and the fimrc template to discover nice Fim features.

	OPEN   BUGS:

20080323	65535 byte limit for a script size (stored in a fim::string) causes problems
		( see scripts/tests/maxlenscript.fim for this )
20070210	fix properly the file parser and max script filelength limit
20070129	control 4 crashes the prog with code 42 ... why ? :)

	MISSING SMALL FIXES:
20070303	fix rar and zip dependencies in Makefiles and such for fimgs.sh
20070303	see if while-nesting is a real danger combined with interruption handling
20070303	update the while construct documentation and fix the while command execution bugs 
20070303	add an interface for setting exitBinding (now Enter!)
20070210	add an interface to modify key bindings and keycode bindings.
20070401	variables : $VARNAME or $(VARNAME) or VARNAME ?

	SCIENCE FICTION WISHED ADD-ONS:
20070307	someday: to integrate with a speech recognizer for command issuing
20070323	image understanding language - based pattern selection
20070401	?= /semanticexp/ operator

	ADD:
20070401	find's -exec '{}' ';' -like predicate syntax
20070125	add pipe to other commands and exec and system (screenshot with fbgrab, for example)
20070128	add support for command renaming with checks...
20070130	proper signal handing for while cycle interruption..
20070201	cwd,ls,pwd,stat,file...

	MISC IDEAS :
20070303
		load cfg, save cfg
		flip=yes|no
		scale=i|i:i|:i|i:|
		fit  =width|height|none|image|min|max
		center=t|b|l|r|tl|tr|bl|br|center
		orientation=90|... [cw|ccw] | flip
		mirror=yes|no
		persistent_options= word*|'*'
		transient_options = word*
		logfile=...
		debugfile=..
		cwd=word
		negative=..
		interpolator=..
		options_style=stacked|trasient|permanent_save	
			function : 
		[n]%[r|l]
		+|-n[%]
20070401	better variable handling : boolean variables, conversion, 'no' prefixing,
		completion fitting the language rules..

	DATES:
20061223	inception
20070202	stress testing (1000+d-) gave : CommandConsole.cpp:577: "pipe error"
20070204	make stricter the policy of recording (only aliases and/or lines.complete the time behaviour
	IDEAS
20070210	eliminate the fresh variable from the config?
20070216	eliminate image tearing by studying the framebuffer device
		repeat_last N ?!
	TIPS
20070302	use __FUNCTION__ : is not ANSI, but GCC
