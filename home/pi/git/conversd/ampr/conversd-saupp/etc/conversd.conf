# Configuration file for saupp-1.62a
# Note that the format has CHANGED slightly from pp/tpp!
#

#
# What to log:
#	critical	Critical errors (which make conversd die)
#	error		Error conditions
#	auth		Authorisation problems (people failing to /oper etc)
#	routing		Routing errors (loops)
#	info		General info (conversd start/stop/restart)
#	link		Link state changes
#	dest		Destination list changes (chatty!)
#	nuser		Network user logins/logouts (lots!)
#	luser		Local user logins/logouts
#	debug		Some debugging info
#	socket		Socket happenings (connections/disconnections, with addresses)
#	config		Configuration file parsing (useful when setting up)
#	channel		Channel state changes (creating, destroying, modes)
#
# You might want to drop "config" from here once you have the thing set up
# and working.
#
Log		critical error auth routing info config

#
# Where to log: syslog, stderr, or both (might want to drop stderr later)
LogDest		syslog stderr

#
# Syslog facility and level (see man page syslog.conf(5) !)
Syslog		daemon info

#
# Server's convers hostname (NOT domain name!), max 9 characters
Server          City_FI

#
# Timezone - use GMT for radio. or "localtime" for regional use.
# If not spezified below, the environment-variable TZ is used. If not set
# then conversd will fall back to GMT.
#Timezone	GMT
#Timezone	localtime

#
# TCP port to listen on (change this and you can run multiple conversd's
# on the same box). If you configure 0, conversd will listen only on a unix
# port
#
#suggested ports:
#convers:	3600
#wconvers:	3610
#lconvers:	6810
Port		3600

#
# Listeners:
# additional listeners (may be inet, unix, ax25, etc..)
# if your interface is dl9sau-8 and you want convers only for incoming
# connections to dl9sau-8:
#Listeners       ax25:dl9sau-8
# if your interface is dl9sau-8 and you want convers only for incoming
# connections to dl9sau-3 via the dl9sau-8 interface
#Listeners	ax25:dl9sau-3,dl9sau-8
# an additional tcp listener:
#Listeners	127.0.0.1:3611
# add an additional unix Listener (for e.g. on a restricted subdir .sockets/)
# (remember to change the allowd unix paths below)
#Listeners unix:/var/cache/conversd/.sockets/convers

#
# Allowed unix path to unix additional unix sockets (each line specifies
# one matching unix path)
#unix_sockets /tcp/.sockets/

#
# Default channel (must be >= 0 and <= 32767), choose one that is not in use
# by other people. 0 is default and causes random channels, if not forced
# with /name <call> 0
#DefaultChan	0
#DefaultChan	9909

#
# DebugChan is a special channel, used by ppconvers in some implementations,
# so activity on this channel is announced to /oper's.
# If you run this conversd as wconvers, or if you dislike thes messages,
# you may want to switch DebugChan to -1.
#DebugChan	-1

#
# If BanZero is true, you cannot join channel 0 on this server
# If DefaultChan is 0 too, then you'll land on a random (empty) channel
# 1 is default
#BanZero	0
#BanZero	1

#

#
# Operator's email address (shown on /sysinfo for problem reports)
Email		your@email.address.here

#
# System information (/sysinfo) (the " must be used)
Sysinfo		"This new convers server is not properly configured by its sysop."

#
# Secret number for gaining conversd operator status (see /help oper)
# must be 0 < x <= 2147483647 (MAX_INT). 0 disables any operator access.
# negative number indicates, that remote operators have local op rights too.
SecretNum	0

#
# Secret passwords (instead of just arithmetic computation of numbers)
# are the more modern way you are encouraged to go. 
# The SecretPass entry defines a password for which is asked in the
# /sys md5 or /sys sys dialogue.
# If Secretpass is not set, the Secretnum entry above is considered as
# "password", and if Secretnum is zero, sysop login is disabled with every
# /sys variant is disabled.
#SecretPass

#
# channel history:
# History lines -1..127, where -1 (or any other negative number) switches
#    history off, 0 stores without limit (not recommended, unless you set a
#    hard exipire date). 64 lines are default
#History_lines 64
# History expires 0...32768, where 0 is never expire (see max lines above),
#    1 is one minute, ...and 32768 is actually 22days..
#    480 (8*60 = 8h) is default.
#    please note that all these lines are stored in memory. negative numbers
#    are depricated.
#History_expires 480

#
# Maxlinks:
# Specify the maximal number of permlinks (the permlink table is static and
# allocated on startup). it's a bit more efficient if you adapt it only when
# the default is too low (see #define DEF_NR_PERMLINKS in conversd.h).
# If you are a greater hub, you may adjust it here, without recompile.
# There is no upper limit (except max signed int - and your swapspace, if
# all permlinks will connect ;)
#Maxlinks 64

#
# Link:
#
# Parameters:	<Remote_host>	<remote_address:port> 	[primary_link] [first line\nsecond line]
#Link		Kuopio_FI	blues.pspt.fi:3600
#Link		Sweden   	rupert.math.kth.se:3600	Kuopio_FI
#Link		Foobar		foo.bar.hes.iki.fi:3600	Sweden   
#Link		db0tud  unix:/tcp/.sockets/netcmd       db0tud  "connect tcp db0tud 3610"
# really geek: connect dl9sau-10 via dl9sau-9 as dl9sau-3 via that linux
# ax25 interface where the call is dl9sau-8.
# 
#Link    test    ax25:dl9sau-10,dl9sau-9<dl9sau-3,dl9sau-8

#
# In the above example, Kuopio_FI is your primary link, Sweden is
# a backup for Kuopio_FI, and Foobar is a backup for Sweden. conversd
# will try to keep connected with Kuopio_FI, and use Sweden and
# Foobar as backups in the listed order of preferrence.
#
# YOU CAN ONLY HAVE ONE PRIMARY LINK. THE NETWORK DOES NOT LIKE LOOPS.
#
# ONLY ONE LINK AND NO INCOMING HOST CONNECTION IS THE BEST CHOICE.
# WITH PRIMARY AND FALLBACK LINKS YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU DO. YOU
# MAY CAUSE REAL HARM TO THE NETWORK.
# THE NETWORK IS LIKE A TREE. IF YOU ARE A LEAF IN THE TREE, PLEASE
# ONLY CONNECT TO A NEIGHBOR IN YOUR BRANCH UPON TO THE ROOT.
# PLEASE DO NOT JUMP FROM ONE BRANCH TO ANOTHER. IT MAY WORK, BUT
# SINCE THERE'S MANY BUGGY SOFTWARE AROUND, IT MOSTLY CAUSES TROUBLE.
#

# New: you may configure alternative links to the same host:
#Link		db0tud  unix:/tcp/.sockets/netcmd       db0tud  "connect tcp db0tud 3610"
#Link		db0tud  db0tud.ampr.org:3600       db0tud

# CallValidate will force valid calls on /name and ax25 connects.
# On other sockets, only valid ampr calls may given.
# 1 is default
#CallValidate	0

# Brandmark unauthenticated users with a preceding "~" in their /personal
# (this way, their status is transparently through the net, and could be
# seen by users on older conversd's too). saupp does not show ~ in /personal,
# but gives this kind of information in the /whois user command.
# Default is 1
#Branduser 0

# Force password authentication when user is already signed on via another
# conversd in the net. When set to 1 and you have already a local connection,
# login will be granted.
# If set to 2, then authentication is forced when your call is online somwhere
# (either if localy, or in the convers net).
# Default is 1
#ForceAuthWhenOn 0

# AcceptAPRSpass is described below. You may like this on AUTH sockets
# for your inet host.
# Default is 0
#AcceptAPRSpass 1

#
# Access control list:
#
# Access <address[/mask]> <BAN|USER|HOST|OBSERVER|RESTRICTED>
#
#	address		can be either an IP address or a hostname.
#	mask		is an optional number specifying the netmask
#			in CIDR notation (number of effective bits). If
#			not specified, defaults to 32 (host).
#	BAN		Do not allow connection
#	DROP		Do quickly drop (close) a new incoming connection,
#			without logging (useful for ax25 listeners, when,
#			regulary the RMNC-digipeater connects)
#	USER		Allow normal user connections
#	HOST		Allow conversd links
#	HOST_SECURE	Allow conversd links from trusted TCP addr (src port < 1024)
#	OBSERVER	Do not allow user connections, let in as observers
#	RESTRICTED	Restricted normal user access
#	AUTH		Password authentication is forced on this socket
#
#	Multiple flags are allowed, but not all combinations make sense.
#	First match applies.
#
# This example would allow amprnet addresses to connect as users,
# 195.148.207.30 to link in too, and deny all other connections.
# Be careful to add the unix socket. The convers client program uses unix
# sockets.
# CAVE: add 127.0.0.1 USER (or HOST, or BOTH), in order that the unix
#       programs cstat(1) or online(2) will be allowed for their request.
# Tip: if you have a flexnet (which connects you periodicaly), add him
#      at the top of the list with the BAN restriction.
# Please note that you need to write ca1ll-0 if ca1ll has no ssid.
#      sorry for that.
# Hint on AUTH sockets: when on a socket AUTHentication is forced, login
#      will be blocked for all users which do not have a password set (see
#      mkpass command).
#      If AUTH is not set, a user may connect, and if he's not set a
#      password, he's marked with a ~ sign when he sends messages.
#      Szenario: if you provide internet access to conversd,
#      you may want to force AUTH. then every user who has once set his
#      password via a normal ampr-link (he's really a ham ;) will be
#      allowed to connect from internet, too.
# Hint on Restricted ax25 sockets:
#      If you like the user to join (/name) with the same call as he's
#      connected to conversd (ax25-call without SSID), you may say
#        Access          ax25:*  USER RESTRICTED
#      This is not the default, because i believe in the user that knows
#      what he does.. But if you have users who are known to abuse,
#      this is your option.
#
#News: - dyndns feature. if you have a permlink with changing IP addresses,
#          you may allow a conection from this network by specifying his
#          network and "RESTRICED": Access 10.0.0.0/8 RESTRICED
#          this will refuse user connections, and allow host connections from
#          this network in exactly that case when the permlink entry exists
#          and his inet address after resolving his inet _name_ exactly matches
#          the connecting IP address. Such a host may be configured in the
#          form "Link foo foo.dyndns.org:0". Currently, only AF_INET hosts
#          could be configured like this.
#	   another variant without the "Link" entry is using an FQDN like
#            Access foo.dyndns.org HOST
#            Access bar.bar.org USER
#          thus connecting IPs with forward resolving of this name to the 
#          connecting IP address will succeed on match.
#          resolving for these forward-resolved entries is done only after
#          3min again (they're cached in order to avoid DOS attacks)
#	   
#      - AUTH sockets: aprs style standard passwords possible if
#          AcceptAPRSpass set to 1. then a user may connect without a local
#          passwort but with the password from the aprs authentication
#          mechanism. user is encouraged to set a real password, and is marked
#          as "unauthenticated" until he does. note that the aprs-standard-
#          password does not overwrite the localy stored password.
