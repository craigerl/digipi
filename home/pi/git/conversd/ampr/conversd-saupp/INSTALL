1. edit the makefile, where the binaries, config files, etc.. have to go.
   I suggest /var/cache/conversd/ where the /pers, /last data go, in
   accordance to the LINUX FHS (if you have a previous convers version,
   i suggest to backup the old directory and move it away)
2. make install
3. if this is your first time you install: make install-all
   cave: every conversd configuration file is overwritten!
3. edit /usr/local/etc/conversd/*conf.
   READ WITH CARE
4. i suggest to add convers to /etc/services
5. a good way to start conversd is to add
	wc:1234:respawn:/usr/local/sbin/ppconversd -f </dev/null >/dev/null 2>&1
   to /etc/inittab. start it once with telinit Q.
6. make /usr/local/etc/conversd/convers.help.de the helpfile for the
   default language with the unix command
     cd /usr/local/etc/conversd/; ln -s conversd.help.de convers.help
   english is the default, done by the makefile
7. see doc/TIPS.txt for some tricky setups
