The Story Board

$Revision: 1.1.1.1 $$Date: 2001/10/10 13:29:59 $

Since there may be users of this code who don't know, how the story began,
here's a short history.

The roots of conversd are in "Packet Radio", this is a networking idea of ama-
teur radio enthusiasts based some ten years ago. Doing a port of the Phil Karns
<karn@qualcomm.com> <ka9q@????>, net code to unix (called WAMPES), Dieter Deyke
<deyke@mdddhd.fc.hp.com> <dk5sg@db0sao.ampr.org> made the ball start rolling in
- I believe - 1986/87. He did the most important part of implementation. Since
there was a very well working implementation in 1992, I started my own source
code tree.

Wolfgang Tremmel <tremmel@ira.uka.de>/<dh2paf@db0sao.ampr.org> did a parallel
work independent from mine. I joined our codes into a new version. The idea of
keeping control of the links by the convers daemons was born and I implemented
a round trip time measurement into the daemon's code. At this point, the name
"Ping-Pong" was created. He also implemented the PCSP-Code which does the tal-
king. This is included the the appropriate Libraries and include files are
found on the system.

Some ideas were given by Walter Koch <dg9ep@db0iz>, who ported the code into
his own digipeater software project (hardware by Werner Cornelius, DG3DBI,
based on V25, called "Falcon") and Bernd Hollerbach (db4ut@db0sao.ampr.org) who
is used to stay up late (right until the morning grows :-)).

Eddy van Loo <eddy@HZeeland.nl> put in the stuff to save /personal info. Thanks
for this work !

I'd like to thank a lot of people being silly enough to try out my code, re-
porting bugs and tell me about new ideas and improvements to the Ping-Pong
conversd. First to be mentioned is Olaf Erb <erb@insu1.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>
on the internet respectively <dc1ik@db0sao.ampr.org> in the ampr-world. He
also did the port of WAMPES to linux, which is my platform. He also added the
LOGGING features for the use with tcpd.

Now you know a bit more...   best wishes, Fred.
