  Hessu's Tampa Ping-Pong conversd URO modified version 1.4

  This is a derivative of TPP-1.14. This is a maintenance / clean-up
  release, and does not contain new major features. It is released only
  to help new conversd operators get all the right patches for tpp-1.14
  and get the thing compiled on modern systems without too much grief.
  A major clean up of the source tree has also been done, to make
  bugfixing and enhancements an easier task.
  
 Fixes in HTPPU-1.4:
	- Edited file Makefile so that user blocking of /join 0
	  (join channel 0) has been lifted by default. This was
	  brought to my attention/request by Doug wb2yxy. After
	  evaluating the usage (or lack there of to be more exact)
	  of the conversd protocol on internet and on our bands
	  I felt as if this request was justified in doing. Spamnet
	  hubs using HTPPU-1.3 have reported great success in using
	  this daemon as such..so as they say "if it ain't broke, don't
	  fix it". Version number has also been bumped up with the
	  change and comments.  Thanks to <all> who have run this
	  cosmetically modified version :-)

 Fixes in HTPPU-1.3:
        - Fixed Y2K logging issue found by Steve N1JFU when doing the
     	  /last command. If a user was found logged in after January 1,
	  2000 the year appeared as 100 instead of 2000
	
	- Shortened version number(s) from a three number numerical 
	  sequence to a two for more compatabilities with other
	  convers softwares reporting such.

 Fixes in HTPPU-1.24:
	- Commented out /cstat and /dest commands due to crashing of the
	  conversd server. More notations are in the ChangeLog file.

  Fixes in HTPPu-1.23:

	- Fixed bug in /bjack command 
		If the nickname was such a total where it would cause the
		display of the /bjack command to go beyond 80 characters
		to the screen it would cause conversd to exit. This is not
		good. Increased buffers from [80] to [2048] JUST to be on 
		the safe side. It shouldn't affect the UX environments. I
		may even decrease this to a lower value in the future.

	- Fixed bug in the /cut command
		Same issue as with the /bjack command.

	- Fixed bug in the /roll command
		Same issue as with the /bjack command.

  Re-added the following in HTPPu-1.22:
        - /nickname command. 
        - /smiley command.
	- /roll command.
	- /cut command.
  
  Added the following NEW commands:

	- /bjack command.
		This command allows the user to play a simulated game of
		BlackJack 21-stud. It is based off of the /cut command
		process.

	- /spam command.
		This command will execute what looks like the 'daemon' is
		saying to the channel. Daemon strings can be edited pretty
		much "on the fly" in a file called spam.txt located in the
		/opt/conversd/etc directory with the smiley.txt file. The
		current default search settings are for [10] lines. If you
		wish to increase the amount of sayings (and this holds true
		for the smiley command and file) you MUST increase this
		setting in the tnos.c file FIRST! Failure to do so will
		either cause conversd to appearantly continue to display
		the last string in the file, or it will not display your
		new adds, depending on what you are doing with it.
	
  Notable differences to TPP and PP:

	- Removed everything that is not needed by the server
	  (the clients, mailgate stuff, bundled libraries). Everyone is
	  using either telnet or a better client program like colrconv or
	  tkconv anyway, right?
	- Cleaned and reindented source for readability (-kr -i8, ansi
	  function prototypes), new Makefile
	- Runs on libc6/glibc, libc5, 64 bit Linux/Alpha without modification
	- Does not include the old OS/2 port (the port was made for some
	  obsolete non-Winsock TCP sockets thing anyway)
	- Removed the Configure script, instead made the source comply
	  better to the standards (should probably run on most if not all
	  POSIX compliant UNIX systems with ANSI C compilers, with minor
	  header file fixes and usually -DNO_SNPRINTF)
	- Removed obsolete and duplicate commands, and also ones that
	  I and my friends don't like to have in convers (/cq is filtered
	  completely, /cut, /nick, etc don't work locally). In my opinion
	  adding duplicate commands for the same function (in hope that it
	  would be easier for the new user to find the function he is
	  looking for) does not help, but makes it harder to learn.
	  Thus, i've removed all of the alias commands Brian added, and
	  made it more like the original conversd in this respect.
	- Optional channel 0 banning. Compile with -DBAN_ZERO and local
	  users cannot access the channel. The channel is still forwarded to
	  all links though.
	- DefaultChan directive in configuration file (it MUST be set and
	  cannot be set to 0).
	- Built-in access lists for better security (by Tomi, OH2BNS)
	- Remembers who set the topic on a channel
	- Better and more configurable logging
	- Better configuration file parser, and better documented example
	  configuration file

  It also contains most of the patches we've received from Brian and others
  after the release of tpp-1.14.
