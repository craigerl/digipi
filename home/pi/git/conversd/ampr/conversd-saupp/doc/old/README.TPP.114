Many bugs and potential bugs were fixed from TPP release 1.13, as well as added
many features, including:

*    Bug to away command, where it notified all with away info, fixed.

*    Bug to read_configuration function, that caused WAMPES-style links
        to fail, fixed.

*    Bug to online program, where a personal ending in "***" caused a
        premature ending to the display, fixed.

*    The '/cstat' command allowed from users and observers.

*    Several places in the code that were case significant and now
        case insignificant.

*    The server (Unix version) now forks off a copy, making the need
        to start with a "&" unneeded.

*    The server (Unix version) now can receive a 'kill -HUP' signal,
        and when received, it drops all users and links, and starts fresh.

*    The '/help' command will now ignore a leading '/' to the command name
        being 'helped' with.

*    A new '/who * <channel>' syntax that lists users on a specific
        channel.

*    Any operators are notified when any new links or destinations
        are added.

*    A new '/stats [[mode] [num]]' command added, to display rx/tx
        statistics. The modes are 'daily' or 'hourly'. The 'num' is the
        number of days/hours to display, up to a maximum of 60 (or the
        number of days/hours uptime). The defaults are hourly mode, up to
        60 hours.

*    New convers.conf file command 'MaxLinks' to change number of
        linked servers without re-compiling

*    Added scanning of a convers.noaccess file, which contains names
        of users that are to be denied access to the server.

*    Data for the '/help' command is now in a convers.help file, allowing
        easy customization.

*    A piece that I missed in TPP 1.13: Added capability for retrieving
        remotely help infomation for extended commands, using a new host
        command '/..HELP'.

*    New convers.conf file command 'LogLevel' to change current logging
        verbosity level.

*    Added multiple levels of logging verbosity, which can be set in the
        convers.conf file, and can be toggled up/down by sending the
        SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals (Unix version only for the signals).
        Current levels are:

  ALWAYS      /* always log */
  NOTHING     /* log nothing at all */
  WARNING     /* log critical events, startup, etc. */
  CONFIG      /* plus log config interpretation */
  LINKS       /* plus log significant events, link up/down, etc. */
  CMDS        /* plus log cmd changes, channel creation, mode changes, etc. */
  USERS       /* plus log user's entry/leaving/channel change - network wide */
  HOSTCMDS    /* plus log all HOST commands received */

*	Changed the algorithm used to produce the operator security number to
	produce a TRUELY random number.

*	Fixed bug which allowed you to 'receive' a destination of your own
	hostname. If this happens, now, it gets bitbucketted.

*	Cleaned up code in the /whois command to properly handle secret and
	invisible channels.

*	Cleaned up code in the quick /who listing, which if a channel were
	BOTH secret and invisible, the secret took precedence. It is now the
	more logical way, having 'invisible' taking precedence.

*	Added the ability to retrieve remote '/links' listings from TPP
	1.14-compatible servers. This was easy done by taking a syntax hole
	in the /links command, and making it work. The four syntaxes for
	the /links command are:

	/links - droplink
	/links hostname group quality hostname:port
	/links remotehost
	/links

	The first removes the host named, 'droplink', by dropping that socket.
	The second adds a new link (or drops the old link and updates information
	on an existing link). The third requests the links display from the
	remote host, 'remotehost'. And the final display displays the
	links info from the current host.

*	Added code to filter out invalid and corrupted /..USER commands. To
	do this three assumptions are made:

	* A proper username contains only printable characters.
	* A proper hostname contains only printable characters.
	* A proper hostname contains at least ONE non-digit.

	Any /..USER entries that fails one or more of these assumption are
	ignored.

*	Fixed a '/whois' bug that wouldn't correctly display data for a user,
	unless they were a LOCAL user.
