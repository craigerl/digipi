Hello World !

There is an important change in pp-conversd 3.02. I just wiped out the channel
number in the /..AWAY internode command. This leads to incompatibilities
to the older versions in the net and perhaps other systems using /..AWAY.

Another thing is the new storage of the log files for /last. Wolfgang, dh2paf
never thought about logfiles being larger than some hundred users, but at
internet sites we use to have some more of them :-)

So I decided to use a hashing algorithm on the user names to keep searching
(and insertion) times smaller. Actually some sysops might want to get rid of
these logfiles, all they have to do is having a look into Makefile.in.
There is a declaration called CDEF8. Uncomment this line, and the logfiles
are gone. Another method is not to create the following directory :-)

All sysops should remove their old logfiles, since they won't be read in
any more. Instead of this file, a new directory (in the old convention it is
/tcp/log for FSSTND compatibles it is /var/local/spool/convers/log) should be
created. There the new files will reside.

I think I'll eat those lousy CDEF lienes later and put them into the
*convers.conf file. So have a look at these README.version-number files.

73, Fred
