*** How to compile and install this conversd installation ! ***

$Revision: 1.1.1.1 $$Date: 2001/10/10 13:29:59 $

What Do you need for the installation ?

*** RECOMMENDED: WAMPES in a newer release notably since 9307?? I guess.
    If you use an older version, the sources must be available on your
    hard disk(s).

    If neither a new nor an old version is online, Configure will figure
    this out (I hope so :-)) and bind only kernel TCP/IP to conversd.
    This feature is untested, but may work. You will have to manage some
    problems, please drop me a note :-)

*** REQUIRED: GNU make is needed since the makefile uses a nice include
    feature.

+++ Quick-Installation +++

Do the following
	# Configure
if your defaults are not WAMPES, /usr/local/bin for user binaries and /tcp
for the daemons set up the appropriate paths in Makefile using
	# vi Makefile
Then do a
	# make install
If set up the first time read the rest of this file and READE carfully ! If
not, reinspect this file for new convers.conf syntax (changes in Rev 2.52)
If all your configs seem to be ok, _and_ the daemons will be restarted by
init(8), then do a
	# make restart

If you do a "make install", conversd is copied into /usr/local/sbin or
wampes' default directory /tcp - change BIN_DIR in Makefile (after the
Configure command to change it). then symbolic links are prepared to have
kaconversd wconversd suconversd and lconversd as secondary conversation
services.

Then convers, ax25, cstat and online are copied into /usr/local/bin
(change UBIN_DIR in Makefile to put it somewhere else), and again the
symbolic links to kaconvers, lconvers, suconvers and wconvers are made
from convers.

At last, the manual pages are being installed into /usr/local/man (or
/usr/man respectively).

---------> Troubleshooting:

***

Q: I get an Error from sh(1). What is wrong ?

A: The configure shell script is running on bash(1). Obtain a proper
   Version (see prep.ai.mit.edu ~/pub/gnu, bash 1.12.tar.gz).

***

Q: I get an Error from make(1). What can I do to make the stuff compile ?

A: The Makefile uses the include feature of the "gnu" make utility.
   Obtain make-3.68.tar.gz from prep.ai.mit.edu:~/pub/gnu. Then compile
   the stuff. You migth run into trouble with that, because your shell
   doesn't work. then get bash-1.12.tar.gz out of the same directory in
   prep.ai.mit.edu.

   An easier way is simply to remove the lines around the include. Then
   dependencies will not be used (Do you _really_ want to change things
   in my horrible code ?). If so, I really can't believe _you_ rtfm :-)

***

Q: My compiler complains about undeclared prototypes and such. Is this
   normal ?

A: No it isn't, but it might work though. My machine is running Linux,
   which is almost POSIX environment. Therefore header files to be in-
   cluded may vary. I use the compiler switch -Wall to get _all_ warnings.
   The whole story should be compiled without one single warning, or
   worse, an error. If it does, check your system for the things that
   are needed, patch the files and send a patch to me. They will be in-
   cluded in later versions if necessary.

***

Q: I can't connect to convers via the unix sockets. Why ?

A: Some unix kernel implementations leave destroyed socket files in
   /tcp/sockets which cannot be overridden by a new one. You have to
   remove these socket file at first. I will fix this problem later.

***

Q: Everything is working fine except no connections are established
   to the remote nodes. Whats wrong ?

A: Check your *convers.conf. PingPong release uses another style -
   Refer to README.

***

Q: The personal names are not being remembered. What can I do ?

A: Create a directory /var/local/spool/convers/personals for this
   version (or /tcp/personals if not FSSTND-compatible). A later
   pp-conversd may use another method to save the personal
   information.

***

Q: The personal names are not stored into a save file. What's wrong ?

A: Create your directory /var/local/spool/convers/personals (or
   /tcp/personals if you are not using FSSTND compatible setups)

***

Q: I get build_socckaddr(): No such file or directory while trying to
   use a convers client. What is wrong ?

A: Have a look into /tcp/hosts. Maybe the entry "127.0.0.1 localhost"
   is missing.

***

Q: My linux box doesn't establish a connection via WAMPES. Why this ?

A: I believe you are using a kernel newer than 1.1.76. Since then the
   unix domain sockets are broken. Actually it leads to a system panic.
   (Don't worry - it's a slight one - only your conversd process is
   kille :-)). A workaround for this was introduced in pp-3.02 since
   Alan Cox doesn't want to fix that problem :-(

   Info for now: Use kernel TCP/IP - Although it is too agressive for
   radio links, it's the only method for now (or downgrade to 1.1.76...)
