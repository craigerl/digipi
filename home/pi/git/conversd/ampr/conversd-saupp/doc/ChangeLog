htpp-1.20: - Feb 11 1999 - Hessu
	- Removed everything that isn't needed (the clients, mailgate stuff, 
	  unnecessary commands, bundled libraries).
	- Ran it through indent -kr -i8.
	- ANSIfied function prototypes.
	- Cleaned up Makefile.
	- Made tnos.c it's own module (not #included in the end of user.c).
	- Fixed header files to include the right stuff.
	- Removed all #ifdef __OS2__ stuff. The port was for some old
	  and obsolete TCP/IP package anyway.
	- Made it compile without barfing using -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes.
	- Removed register keywords from variables, compilers are smarter
	  than us these days anyway.
	- Added some more error checking and logging in places.
	- Fixed write_pid().
	- Fixed a couple of bugs in destination list handling.
	- Added a better and cleaner configuration file parser.
	- Separated command line argument parsing and implemented it
	  using getopt().
	* Dumped libwrap and added access control lists in the config file
	  (thanks go to Tomi, OH2BNS).
	
htpp-1.21: - Mar 13 1999 - Hessu
	- Removed gethostbyaddr() from accept_connect_request(), was only
	  used for logging, mostly useless and made accepting connections
	  from non-resolvable hosts with unreachable DNS servers REALLY
	  slow, blocking the whole server.
	- Added checks for some illegal configuration file statements.

htpp-1.22: - Apr 25 1999 - Hessu
	- Fixed a security bug (allowing an DOS attack) in the /help command.
	- Added a workaround to keep some certain ancient gods quiet.
	- Ugly hack involving a sleep(10); to avoid fallback to primary link
	  from looking like a loop and causing link vibration. Really closes
	  the backup link before relinking and waits for the information to
	  (hopefully) propagate to the primary server.

htppu-1.22: - May 29 1999 - Brian
	- Readded the following commands:
	  nickname, roll, cut, smiley
	- Added new commands:
	  spam, bjack. See the README file on these.
        - Increased string length for nickname usage to go beyond 10
          characters 
	- changed "link failure" text to my signature "stinky linky" 

htppu-1.23: -  July 3 1999 - Brian
	- Fixed bug in /bjack command where if the total displayed
          characters of the combined nickname and command string exceeded
	  80 characters, this caused htppu to exit. NOT GOOD eh? Fix was
	  to increase the buffers from [80] to a higher value. Currently
	  I have it set default for [2048]. While this is extremely high
	  I have found it to be ok under debian linux kernel 2.0.36. I
	  may change this in the future if I receive enough suggestions
	  er...complaints :-)
	- Fixed similar bug in regards to the /cut command.
	  Same exact problem re: display length.
	- Fixed similar bug in regards to the /roll command.

htppu-1.24: - January 1 2000 - Brian (Happy New Year!)
	- Commented out two commands that were previously incorporated into
	  tpp/htpp/htppu. /dest and /cstat would occasionally crash the
	  conversd server when used at times. Currently the cause is unknown
	  and I do hope that a fix can be found and these commands restored.
	  Currently I urge anyone who's using tpp/htpp/htppu to upgrade to
	  htppu-1.24 or simply comment out these commands.

htppu-1.3:  - January 30 2000 - Brian
	- Fixed Y2K bug in user logging found by Steve N1JFU
	- Shortened version numbers to be more compatable with other
	  convers server software.
	- Please note: Detailed information will now be found in the README
	  file as the ChangeLog will be for breif summaries.

htppu-1.4:  - December 6 2000 - Brian
	- Changed Makefile so that channel 0 ban is lifted by request
	  of Doug WB2YXY. After much though, I felt with the lack of
	  users now on convers it was no longer needed to lock a user
	  out of channel 0.
