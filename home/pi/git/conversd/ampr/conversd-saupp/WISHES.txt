- service access to convers for conversd messages, for e.g. privmsg
  "*** you have new mail at ..."
- no: partly done: compression (on link layer ax25 //COMP standard) - also for permlinks.
    needs config file option, or a /profile also for permlinks?
    need a config option for non-8bit capable sockets (shell login for e.g.
    with standard axspawn)
  -> the //comp standard is not binary clean. not usable on permlinks.
     will need to look after gzip or bzip2 compression
- crc on compressed links? - disconnect on crc errors?
- authentication when connecting permlinks (flexnet standard, md5auth, etc..)
- when user authentication, then resume of convers-sessions on the same
  node
- /op should be able to change profile (password), if necessary
- better /..DEST handling
- connect-dialogue through digipeaters to a neighbour

- work in progress: a protocol standard for convers client programs, to
  get rid of the multible parsing problems while designing a GUI-convers
  client which could understand every conversd-version being around.
  thomas <dg1rtf> is currently working on an irc-client implementation for
  convers.

- done: /history for the last n lines on a channel
- done: iso problems with ^N without ^O on /pers, /topic, ..
  will need to work on /charset.
- done: evaluate "\r*** DB0LUC: Link failure with DB0BLN\r\r" on permlinks
- done: better AX25-connect code (digipeaters, sourcecall)
- done: netrom / rose / ... support
- done: listeners for unix and incoming ax25 connections
-> hmm, what we want is the ultimative socket-code to connect to a
   socket type what-o-ever the future will bring ;)))
   i've some ideas - we'll C..
  done: ;)))

- done: optimize appendstring (some data has trailling spaces)

- more languages (/lang) for /help [thlingon, etc.. ;-]
- more readable layout of the english helpfile

- a /timer command for periodicaly sheduling convers commands
- paclen autodetermination through ioctl(fd, ..). config for permlink?

- GNU autoconf
- install-dialogue
- debian package

- better feedback from you and your users concerning any bugs you've found..
