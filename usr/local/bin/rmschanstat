# Description:
#	Basic channel status checker script for Linux RMS Gateway ACI
#	operations.
#
# Usage:
#	rmschanstat <type> <name> <call>
# where:
#	type is the type of channel (e.g., ax25)
#	name is the name of the channel
#	call is the callsign associated with the channel
#
# To support the ACI, the program exits with a status of zero (0) if the
# channel is available and non-zero exit status if the channel is not
# deemed available. The ACI uses this fact to determine what to do for
# the status update to the Winlink 2000 system.
#
# Note: only type 'ax25' is recognized at this time, but the script should
# be useful as a base for other specialized setups. The channel definitions
# found in /usr/local/etc/rmsgw/channels.xml have a <statuschecker> element which
# provides the name of the script/program and arguments for the ACI to call
# to query the availablity of the channel.
