DigiPi code and config files

This repository is all of my original code, and modifications to 
existing GPL code that goes into the DigiPi project.  This is not
a recipie for creating a bootable SD card image, though, that'd
be a cool feature at some point.

This code is largely for developers wanting to create their own
radio/digipi project, GPL-compliance, and education.

To get a completed SD card image, patrons of http://patreon.com/KM6LYW
may download the image at https://digipi.org/

Thank you for your support,
